Review
New one on Drive looks..interesting.Toyota's new design language is taking shape. Odd shapes! The rear tail-lights and overall shaping takes on new VW Tiguan looks, the front is a mashup of current RAV4, Hyundai Tucson and a bit of the Ford Echo.Interior looks bland apart from interesting shape of the ��� cupholder! That's about all I can say. Though the detailing around the air vents on the dash looks nice-ish and the 'pockets' in the lower dash areas look original and useful.
Looks pretty good aside from the wheelarch treatment that looks way too Jeep Compass...Looks a lot more premium and substantial than the previous model.  Pity no stripper spec manual without all the safety stuff...
I saw the pics and was really, really surprised at the direction. Kind of reminds me of a mini FJ cruiser?I think it will sell extremely well to those who want a JEEP for the sake of a JEEP but can���t afford to run them or take the risk on the brand.
Looks great, the Hybrid of this is the only car on the horizon that I would consider trading in my car for. Will check it out.

Will check it out.I've been looking at the Lexus NX hybrid, but may hold off for the Rav 4. The 2.5 litre hybrid engine is great. I currently have the same engine in my Camry Hybrid.I wish Toyota would just release the Kluger Hybrid as I can't stomach the 110K for the Lexus RX 450 and would prefer a big SUV. The 450H gets under 9l/100k which is amazing for its weight!
tannins writes...The 2.5 litre hybrid engine is great. I currently have the same engine in my Camry Hybrid.Unless your Camry Hybrid is a new 70 series, although the engines are both 2.5 litre, they are completely different. The 50 series Camry Hybrid runs a 2AR-FXE. The 70 series Camry Hybrid, and this upcoming RAV4 Hybrid, utilise a A25A-FXS, along with an upgraded hybrid system.
It won't happen but I'd like a basic spec hybrid with a moonroof and vented seats.
Anyone heard when it's going on sale in Australia?

If only they re-introduced a N/A V6 to the RAV4 lineup.. Like the 2018 Camry.

The 2019 Toyota Rav4 is similar to the 2019 Lexus UX. both being released early 2019.
toyota seem to be banging out increasingly good looking and 'decent' performing cars but still at user friendly prices.  I was going to be all over a hybrid camry, but will wait and see how the rav4hydbrid ends up sitting price and performance wise.
richardJF writes...But you haven't asked about the spec you wantGood point ��� was keen to know more about the hybrid version. There wasn���t a direct comparison that I was aware of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yNvcZ03BQQHere's a pre-embargo review, which is more of a first look at the car since they are not allowed to talk about too many specifics until the end of November. The car seems decent but nothing too outstanding at the moment. The hybrid will likely be the most interesting.
Square wheel arches so wrong- few car makers are going this way!

After owning a CX5, my two cents is, if you care about reliability, wait a few months for the Rav.

lazza writes...really? what's wrong with it? which model do you have?I have the prior generation, it spent more time at the dealer than it did at my home in the first couple years. First major failure was transmission at 20k. Transmission replaced again shortly after. Now genuinely looking to get rid of it for a well known engine issue before it blows. Car has done 47kBought the wife a Toyota for work last year, early days but zero issues with it. Completely different experience from the Mazda. I say Consumer Reports average rating for Mazda reliability is spot on from my experience.
Wow thanks for the tip. have they fixed all the issues in the current generation model?
lazza writes...have they fixed all the issues in the current generation model?My opinion is that yes reliability has certainly got better, but Mazda reliability is still a bit hit and miss. Exactly the rating Consumer reports have given. (Bottom of the Japanese brands)Buying a first model year of the Rav redesign will also have a few issues no doubt, but given Toyotas track record i doubt anything like catastrophic engine/transmission failure.
Haylonix writes...genuinely looking to get rid of it for a well known engine issue before it blows. Car has done 47kWhich is? Wife���s 2016 Cx5 has 59k on it, been melb-Queensland twice and never had a single issue?
lazza writes...Wow thanks for the tip. have they fixed all the issues in the current generation model?There are no major frequent issues. KE CX5 had some diesel issues when they first came out, but essentially petrol versions are Mazda 3s on stilts which has a PROVEN trach record of reliability.The above poster has had some bad luck with his/her which is very uncommon. Don���t let that be a deterrent.And the new KF CX5 is essentially a new dress. Under the bonnet has hardly changed- a few tweaks here and there.The RAV 4 will be good, but Toyota are about the only  jap company that are behind or lacking in most safety tech. Base models lack a lot compared to rivals and are usually severely over priced for what you get. And of course coupled with a CVT which is a different ���drive feel��� compared to a regular auto.I���d still consider it, but definitely compare kit with the Mazda if you like them.
F55Coops writes...I���d still consider it, but definitely compare kit with the Mazda if you like themAnd then Mazda has the 2.5l turbo coming out soon too.
it would be good if they offered a 2.5L FWD version of the RAV 4 in Aus. having a AWD version is kind of pointless in the suburbs.Take for example the x-trail or outlander.also the RAV 4 is over priced for what it is too.

Details of engines for Australia. Bet hybrid will be a smash hithttps://www.caradvice.com.au/701237/2019-toyota-rav4-engine-australia/
Bello writes...Bet hybrid will be a smash hitI've heard great things about the hybrid. The 2.5 looks like it packs a lot more punch than the outgoing model. And the 2L is decent too for those that want a manual (I also wish they'd make the large engine size in manual).Ticks a lot of boxes for me.
Am also looking at the CX-5 vs RAV4 now. Toyota just seems so much more reliable.Really hope the hybrid is under 50k
152kw for a NA 2.5 litre engine is quite impressive. I know why the hybrid going to be a hit. The electric drive down to the rear wheels.
DJSIEK writes...Really hope the hybrid is under 50kToyota will do the same thing they've done with new gen Camry (with exception of Camry SX) and Corolla ��� offer the hybrid drivetrain as an option on all variants. 50 series RAV4 GX hybrid will be in the high $30K or very early $40K range.
individualist writes...152kw for a NA 2.5 litre engine is quite impressiveNot really. Lexus has had a NA 2.5L V6 producing 158kw/250Nm for many many years. Although this new 2.5L is probably more fuel efficient.
Car looks good inside and out, even the base model has AEB, Lane guidance and Adaptive Cruise (something even the 'techy' Tesla Model 3 doesn't come with as standard)It would be nice if Toyota offered a BEV variant :( a Rav4 PHEV with like 50km real world electric range would be a seriously attractive buy
Roger Scape writes...It would be nice if Toyota offered a BEV variant :( a Rav4 PHEV with like 50km real world electric range would be a seriously attractive buyToyota have basically said they won't do a plug in.  I rekon they are in it for the long game and going hydrogen. I tend to side with Toyota in terms of tech ��� when everyone went diesel mad they stuck to their hybrid guns because, well most people that are familiar with combustion would tell you it wasn't ever cleaner than petrol.

foresterbloke writes...Which is why there's a RAV4 diesel and diesel models across the range in Europe?It was a real half arsed effort. Toyota only applied it to their awd range. Unlike the euros who plastered diesels across their entire range.

DrMilan writes...anyone know where these are being built?Australian model will be sourced from Japan.
Calvin_wp writes...Toyota have basically said they won't do a plug inIt is unfortunate but I assume it's a mixture of cost and parts. The hybrids all use NiMH for a start, although some (maybe all?) Lexus hybrids use lithium plus the normal Hybrid motors aren't upto the task of extended fast higher speed use.The new Rav4 is imo still a very attractive buy for consumers, even without PHEV.
Roger Scape writes...The new Rav4 is imo still a very attractive buy for consumers, even without PHEV.Yeah I really need a new car and this is the only one on he horizon that remotely interests me. Either that or they could do me a favor and bring the rolla wagon over.

Hybrid seems to be the way to go with the price of fuel. Toytoas petrol fuel economy is terrible with the current rav4. Cant see that changing much.Hope the hybrid has a good trans and ill be sold

It���s a shame it appears that the Adventure grade does not come in hybrid
I'm struggling here too ��� really need to know pricing to make a decision on Cx5 vs this one ��� I was so close to gettting a Kona EV when they came out but it's way too small (I sat in a kona petrol model as they're meant to be similiar) but don't know what i expected for a small SUV.Either way this RAV4  Hybrid is so hot and may be worth waiting 6 months.Anyone think it will be sub 50k AUD?
DJSIEK writes...Anyone think it will be sub 50k AUDI'd gurantee it
DJSIEK writes...I'm struggling here too ��� really need to know pricing to make a decision on Cx5Are you cross shopping the cx5 with the rav hybrid? Hybrid will cost more for sure than a cx5 depending on which grade. If you are going for petrol, I'd still go for the rav. It has dual manifold and direct injection as opposed to the cx5 which presumably will only have direct injection.
Yes I am putting the CX5 Akera against the Rav4 Hyrid. The cx5 akera on road is 48k. I should be able to get 10% of the RRP hopefully. Toyota dealers tho I have not bought a Toyota before so don't have an "in".This car is just gorgeous (rav4 2019). And i'm willing to wait until Q2 2019 for it..Safety wise tech ��� the Rav4 doesnt' seem to have the following available at all (happy to be corrected): Emergency Stop Signal (ESS) (Akera Standard)Driver Attention Alert (DAA) (Akera Standard)and based on the Toyota Safety 2.0 details page the following is additional cost but standard on Akera:Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) Standard 360 view monitor StandardBlind Spot Monitoring (BSM) StandardI really like the DAA feature ( don't worry i don't text and drive ��� I just like it for peace of mind)

Im stuck between getting the vti-lx crv, current Mazda cx5 AKera, waiting for the turbo version of Mazda cx5 AKera which will come out early next month or waiting for the new RAV4 which is due in April.
If you are in no rush, I would definitely wait for the hybrid RAV4 to test outI���d be wary of touching a CRV due to the oil life monitor service schedule. Some owners are getting instruction to have a service at a 5000km interval
Rav4 2019 is def Q2 right? Q1 would be lovely.
yea i agree it would be awesome if q1. been waiting for a new car since September. hoping the hybrid version is around 50k mark then i would get it. anyone went to a dealer yet and book an appointment for a test drive when it arrives?
i'm tempted to do so. My folks have a 4 year old carolla and i find the entertainment system really slow. Based on videos, newer T's entertainment system is fast.I need to find a good Toyota dealer in Melbourne!
Will the RAV4 have CarPlay

If it doesnt have android auto i sure hope the headunit is easy to replace

Yea i found the car seats fixtures on the top funny but not a deal breaker. Everything else about the crv is really good. Just wish it came with 360 camera n i would be sold on the crv. Especially now with 7 yr warranty n road side assistance.
Since they claim 3y warranty is all we need since their cars are so reliable tell the dealer to throw in 3y/150k km factory extended warranty for free and put their money where their mouth is. You probably wont get any discount anyways so they at least can do that.

Thanks for explaining.Yeah it won't be the deciding factor. But daa would be great. Looks like they are likely to have that feature.Deciding factor for me will be price

By Richard's figures the hybrid will get 10 miles more per gallon; almost 30% greater distance!Richard can confirm but I suspect these are US fuel consumption figures. The US gallon is smaller than an Imperial gallon. The conversion is approx. 1 Imp gal equals 1.2 US gal.
Crazy to read the camry got drive car of the year. Yet the rav4 sounds like its  far from the market leader. Interesting to see what the local reviews think when it actually arrives

kent writes...When does that mean we can start negotiating on pricing?Yes you can start to negotiate on the price. The amount of discount you get will depend on many factors like:- Model you are after- Stock being made available to the dealers- Reviews this Rav4 gets from local media like caradvice- Discounting on the runout Rav4 etc
Pressroom release today with a little more info on variants and features.
I would like to buy a Rav4 as soon as it becomes to the market. Is there any strategy I would follow to get a good price?
Shame Toyota didn't offer their 3.5L V6 as an option..
Manual in the base, 8 speed auto in the Edge otherwise it's rubber bands.......(albeit with a real first gear to lessen the rubber band feel). Seems everywhere else at least gets a choice of 8 speed auto in the non-hybrids. And all the 'safety', oh well I guess Aust. has been chosen, with it's insouciant population and wide open spaces, as being at the cutting edge of driverless techs.Pricing and optional accessories will be interesting to see.
Carsales mentioned that pricing starts from $31k, so it would be the same as current Rav4 price.Also with 5 yrs warranty. That's cool.

sunmax2 writes...Mind sharing here? Are you a dealer btwNo not a dealer ��� run carloop. Here are some tips:- It's always good to know what other owners are paying so you have something to stand on (you can ask here on WP or request a report from carloop)- Check dealership stock on their websites (if they have it in stock, they would want to move it as quickly as possible ��� hence a better deal for you)- Buying closer to the end of the month helps as some dealers might be behind their sales targets- As for negotiation, first negotiate a price without accessories. Then talk to them about throwing a few in (mats, tank of fuel etc.)- Get offer from one dealer and then use it as a starting point for dealing with other dealers (preferably those in the outer suburbs/regional areas)- If you have a trade in, try and sell that car privately (there is a big market for it and you would get much more than you would from the dealers).Hope it helps.

AMG S writes...CarPlayI believe somewhere thru the thread other people have mentioned there will be ACP but AA will not make it.But all speculation until Toyota release some official specs, but they were never keen on AA because of "security/safety" reasons.Funny as well because their security was breached recently anyway!
CarAdvice confirm CarPlay is not available with aus spec car , is au spec rav4 made in Japan or US ?
Very Poor performance by the new Rav4 on the tried and tested Moose test (AWD hybrid tested)https://youtu.be/j3qrCNR4U9A

Any idea why the Au models won���t get CarPlay? Seems crazy that they would omit such a popular feature on an all new vehicle. Especially when other markets are getting it.

Wouldn't out pricing info be closest to NZ'D? (which looks similar price as current model anyway?)https://www.toyota.co.nz/new-vehicles/rav4/But I've spoken to few AU dealers they said should be few grand more than current. Don't know how accurate it is.
Saw heaps of them this morning on their way from Fremantle to Welshpool. So cant be too far away
Looks like it may have Apple Carplay. Saw a comment on Facebook from Toyota Australia where someone was disappointed about the lack of Carplay. Toyota's reply 'wait for the specifications to be released' or similar.

Biggest disappointment for me is no CarPlay and bad infotainment system with low resolution camera
Does anyone know exactly when the new model would be available in Perth?
PhoneFan writes...If you have more detailed information kindly share it for everyone���s benefit.I do know people at Toyota that aren���t in dealership land. They���ve been very coy when I asked questions about ACP and AA.The issue is that Toyota moves vehicles without it, so head office doesn���t see it as a deal breaker for the AU market.  <<- from the horses mouth per seKeep in mind most of the AU market vehicles are tested and modified to suit our environment. We don���t get the same worldwide platform most manufacturers dish outFWIW, we���ve got the latest model Kluger and whilst it doesn���t have ACP or AA, the connectivity is sufficientDon���t get me wrong, ACP/AA would be nice to have but I���m buying into the vehicle platform and I doubt Toyota is really losing many sales due to this.

Another dealer has emailed pricing for the hybrids, this looks much better than what was quoted to me earlier.Hybrid Pricing:GX 2WD Hybrid $35,140GX AWD Hybrid $38,140GXL 2WD Hybrid $38,140 GXL AWD Hybrid $41,140CRUISER HYBRID 2WD $41,640 CRUISER HYBRID AWD $44,640Still this pricing is unconfirmed until Toyota themselves release it*Also says Apple CarPlay & Android Auto will become available by the end of the year, i've already emailed back asking if it's retrofittable.Will keeps you's updated.

Pretty good RRP there, I was expecting Cruiser AWD Hybrid to breach 50kSeems pretty cheap upgrade of 6.5k to go from bottom of range GX to top of range Cruiser
Agree that is a pretty good pricing.
Those prices do look very attractive. Given the demand for the Camry Hybrid there will be presumably no deals for a good while. If it's as good as the US YouTube reviews I will certain look at trading my 2014 X-Trail. The question will be when is the optimum time to do it?
DockTony writes...The question will be when is the optimum time to do it?there's never the optimum time.wait and leave it too late and the whole thing of "yolo" comes into your mind.do it too early and you pay top dollar. damn cars.but if I had a 2014 X-Trail, I would do it asap as I do not like it (X-Trail) very much. the premium is justified.

Toyota still have the current RAV 4 at its regular pricing. The cruiser is still 50k and glx 40k. Also found when speaking  to them not that keen on discounting much either. Insane to buy a runout model at these prices when the new one will be similar.

(Assuming specs of GX is same as Hybrid Camry Ascent Sport which is $32k)I can't see the top spec Cruiser Hybrid being $41.6k though. The top spec Camry SL Hybrid is $41k and there is basically no increase for jumping into a RAV4? This would basically kill all Camry SL sales if true. Why would anyone in the current market buy a sedan when they can get a SUV for a few hundred more? (Although I must admit I love sedans)
Anfs sedan buyers and suv buyers are completely different.I for one love sedans,would never buy a suv.

Curious to know what people think about the hybrid system. We're in the market for a mid-size SUV for $35k, currently, the Hyundai Tuscon ActiveX with safety is looking good, but I really like what I've seen and read about the new RAV4. From what I can tell, the RAV4 GX Hybrid and the RAV4 GXL Petrol are likely to be both around $35k, the hybrid adds most of the features that the GXL has over the GX.I like the idea of electric cars, part of the appeal is the simplicity. Obviously, a hybrid is adding complexity but it seems Toyota are using it in a few other platforms already. Given the Hybrid GX and the Petrol GXL are (in terms of features I care about) essentially the same besides the power system, does the Hybrid make sense?Not needing to refuel as often and saving a little on petrol is nice too. Are there batteries in the same way a Tesla has batteries, or are they more of a short/medium term storage like capacitors of some type? Having to fork out thousands of dollars to replace batteries in 5 years or so isn't particularly appealing and seems like something worth considering. We're planning to keep this car for quite a while, perhaps 10 years or so, maybe more.
JustinTH writes...Not needing to refuel as often and saving a little on petrol is nice too. Are there batteries in the same way a Tesla has batteries, or are they more of a short/medium term storage like capacitors of some typeThe hybrid drivetrain in Toyotas has been around 20yrs. Surely you  had a bit of a look round the internet on how it works.By the way, where did you get the detailed specs of the range?The range is GX, GXL and Cruiser in 2l petrol fwd and 2.5l hybrid fwd and awd.  The then edge in 2.5l petrol awd
JustinTH writes...Are there batteries in the same way a Tesla has batteries,They are not known to spontaneously catch fire.They are batteries, a different chemistry than Tesla use, and a lot less capacity.Doing the sums based on camry price and fuel differences there is about 3-4 year payback period for the fuel savings to make up the difference. And the battery should last 10 years (8yr warranty) and cost $3k to replace (possibly less in 10 years time).Apart from the fuel savings the hybrid gives some performance increase with both motors working in unison which gives you more responsive acceleration.

I've as good as sold myself a RAV4 hybrid (don't tell my dealer), just a question of when is the best time and which spec to go for. Apart from all the safety stuff in the new one, a key plus for me is the limousine-like smoothness in town driving with (assuming it's the same as the Prius) seamless transitioning between petrol and electric. Another plus of hybrids is that if you drive sensibly you'll probably never need to replace brake pads or rotors as the regen braking will do most of the work.

This site: https://www2.greencarreports.com/news/1120010_2019-toyota-rav4-hybrid-first-drive-review-all-the-bits-and-pieces-in-placeSays the EPA reported value matched their short test drive of 39MPG, which is 6L/100km. I'm not sure how different the US version is though. Around 6L/100km seems to be around about what I could find on other sites, but it's such a variable thing. The smallest ICE only efficiency was around 9-10L/100km. Even 6 vs 9, it's still over $800/year if you're doing around 20,000km.
JustinTH writes...Even 6 vs 9, it's still over $800/year if you're doing around 20,000kmJust remember to factor in the fact the hybrid needs premium unleaded compared to the normal 2.5l.EDIT: Just did some quick calcs based on today's fuel price at my local servo.

stumpy85 writes...Just remember to factor in the fact the hybrid needs premium unleaded compared to the normal 2.5l.How confident are you in that fact?The NZ site says 91 or higher for both: https://www.toyota.co.nz/new-car/rav4/RAV4-AHAX-NM1/?skuCode=RAV4-AHAX-NM1-1D6-20#specificationsThe efficiency quoted on the NZ Toyota site is 6L/100km for the 2.0L Petrol and 4.8L/100km for the 2.5L Hybrid. That reduces the savings significantly but I'm more inclined to believe the review figures than the manufacturer website.
JustinTH writes...How confident are you in that fact?If it's the same motor from the new Camry, I'm 100% certain. It has a 14:1 compression ratio, so needs 95 minimum according to Toyota Australia.
I'm following another thread on ozbargain https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/454005/comments and there is someone who works at a Toyota dealer. He confirmed the prices for the hybrids quoted above are correct, they are the car price including gst but excluding on-road costs.Stamp duty varies between the models (and between states), so anywhere from $4,000-$7,000 extra for on-roads (roughly)Looks like a Hybrid is probably out of the question for me, our budget is $35k, I could justify stretching an extra couple of grand with the fuel savings, but I doubt they'll be negotiating on price too much.
JustinTH writes...He confirmed the prices for the hybrids quoted above are correct, they are the car price including gst but excluding on-road costs.Interesting. It seems that with an extra $4k or so on-roads, the NZ cars will be cheaper. Especially considering the slightly stronger AUD.

What reasonable price can i get for the GLX Cruiser 2WD Hybrid?Website shows 46.5k..
The hybrid system combines a 2.5-litre Atkinson cycle four-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor generator that drives through a CVT, providing the most powerful drivetrain in the range with combined maximum outputs of 160kW for 2WD variants and 163kW for AWD versions
#Tonez writes...hat reasonable price can i get for the GLX Cruiser 2WD Hybrid?From what I've been told and read so far it doesn't sound like there's likely to be much movement in price for a while at least.

I just test drove a Cruiser and GXL both in 2WD Hybrid specification. They both drove nicely as expected. I was quoted $43,355 on road for the GXL Hybrid 2WD and $47,250 for the Cruiser Hybrid 2WD. I like the Atomic Rush (red) and Electric Blue colours the best. Hmmmm���.food for thought

The two key forces of SUV demand and hybrid demand come together with Toyota's 10 year battery warranty and 7 year driveline warranty (5yrs + 2yrs for compliant dealer servicing) in an excellent package. There's more likely going to be long waiting lists similar to the Camry hybrid and Corolla hybrids.

Do I understand correctly that the hybrid AWD is a permanent 4WD system with power being apportioned between front and back to maintain traction and stability as the system thinks best? As opposed to a traditional 4WD where the driver chooses to engage 4WD when judged necessary? Can't decide from what I've read whether AWD is worth it for sealed road driving. Potentially better stability if you hit an ice or grease patch?
DockTony writes...Can't decide from what I've read whether AWD is worth it for sealed road driving. Potentially better stability if you hit an ice or grease patch?Maybe if someone lives where snow falls then there would be a benefit on sealed roads worth the cost
Has anyone managed to bargain the price down at all?We're looking at the 2WD Hybrid GX, the salesman seemed fairly set on not negotiating but I imagine they're probably good at that. I get anxious just chatting to people I don't know, aggressive bargaining is not something I'm good at.

I'll probably say the best way to answer is that you likely can't flick a switch and have it run awd all the time. The batteries will drain too quickly if anything.

Kilavan writes...Is it worth to buy Hybrid GX? Is it worth the petrol cost difference?Depends on your mileage and what sort of driving. Driving up a freeway occasionally, not worth it. Lots of urban driving, probably yes. e.g. assume consumptions of 5.0 for the hybrid and 7.0 not, 12,000km p.a, that's 600/840 litres, annual saving 240 = $350. If stop-start traffic the hybrid consumption won't change much, whilst it will increase significantly otherwise.A hidden saving is on brakes: if you drive sensibly and let the regen braking do the work, you'll not have to replace pads or rotors for a long long time, if ever.
Kilavan writes...Is it worth to buy Hybrid GX? Is it worth the petrol cost difference?It is about 2.5l/100km difference in advertised numbers. May be different in real world.At $1.5 a litre that is $3.75 per 100km.$375 per 10000km. Maybe some savings on brakes. So the pay pack period is pretty long.Note the are other advantages related to extra power.
Kilavan writes...Is it worth to buy Hybrid GX? Is it worth the petrol cost difference?Hard to say. Your only real comparison is the 2.0L which is a different beast. To go up to the awd 2.5L you are looking at quite a price jump from the hybrid GX.On a side note, does anyone have an opinion of towing? On one hand I have an opinion not to use CVT for any towing whatsoever, but on the other hand the disconnected hybrid drive ofthe awd and the launch gear of the cvt should aleiviate some of the problems?
Another thing to consider with the Hybrid GX is that you get the better LED headlights, dual zone climate control and smart start. This is the spec sheet, makes it easy to compare. https://www.toyota.com.au/main/-/media/toyota/main-site/vehicle-hubs/rav4/files/rav4-spec-data-may2019.pdf

I don't know which is better or if they're just different.
Performance and refinement is way better in the hybrid. Drive a normal Camry and a hybrid one back to back and they are like two totally different cars.GX Hybrid would be a great family car for many
Although all use LED headlights, petrols use parabolic lenses, hybrids use projectors.
And if the projectors are better than the parabolic self leveling ones, then the top spec edge misses out?
crazy horse writes...Note the are other advantages related to extra power.In the older models of hybrid, I can feel the lagging when power is transferred from electric motors to the petrol engine. Is it still the same?

The battery has 10 warrenty I think. That's along time
Yeah, 8 year warranty and then an additional 2 if you get it checked by Toyota regularly. The salesman told me "about 2.5k" to replace the batteries at the moment. I'd read $3k elsewhere, but either way, that doesn't seem like a lot after 10 years. It's hard to imagine that that price wouldn't come down significantly between now and 2029.

Battery price may come down but labour costs will go up
Anyone put in an order yet? Curious what's the drive away price
Menco writes...Battery price may come down but labour costs will go upWhat's your reasoning behind that? I would have thought as electric vehicles become more popular there will be more need for battery replacement, more places doing it and therefore more competition. I don't think I'm going to be too concerned about having Toyota being the ones replacing batteries in my 10 year old RAV4. I'm sure the mechanic over the road could do it.
I wrote off my 2016 Rav today. While I was waiting for the towy the dealer phoned me trying to get me to over for  a test drive of a '19I'm secretly blaming the dealer.

Wow, great price and the exact colour and spec I���m looking for. Is that with on road costs?Enjoy the new car.
I'd like to hear if anyone has seen the seat covers, all weather mats and/or carpet mats. I've never bought a new car before, these are things I'd like but I'm not sure if I'm better off getting the OEM stuff or aftermarket. I'm interested in quality and price, I haven't heard anything about accessories from anyone yet. Also, are front mud guards something worth considering for just every day driving?
I think it looks really good in flesh, especially in graphite. Boot doesnt seem overly big, but tons of rear leg room. Steering goes from very light at parking speeds to weighted on the road, takes a bit to get used to.Drives fine, nothing amazing, easy car to commute in. Good enough power and you can feel the electric kick in. Id happily own one, just going to compare some brands.I got a bit annoyed with the speed zone voice warnings (which can turn off im told) and the lane assist is way to intrusive, contantly tugging at the wheel. Id keep that off 90% of the time, unless slugging a long trip. I found the dash cluster a bit cluttered. The icons for drive mode, cruise, lane warnings are just all over the shop.I tried the gxl and didnt find the uprated wheel to feel that nice, id like to see what the gx wheel is like

Went to the RAV4 launch at Motorama Toyota Moorooka,Didn't get to test drive or discuss pricing but they had a good variety of models there. Sat in the Hybrid Cruiser and it felt abit dull & dark everything felt solid though. I was surprised how much I liked the Edge in Jungle Khaki with Orchid Brown and Light grey interior! Looks really good imo.Also the auto tailgates annoying with it being slow it also beeps away while in motion. Hope you can disable the beeps completely. And disappointed the Edge misses out on drivers seat memory.

RAV4 have always been over priced.  Toyota have always tried to equate durability with price even though other marques trump Toyota on design and tech for the same price.
The old RAV4 was way overpriced and not a good car to live with due to 6 month servicing, lack of rear air vents, average features/performance, cheap interior and mediocre fuel economy.But I think the new RAV4 is ripper value. Seems to be the class benchmark in hybrid form
Yes that is with On Road cost. Dont believe the crap it being a new model. You will get return calls. Dont be afraid to walk away. They will call you.
learner99 writes...Are you referring to lane changing without indicating? or some other scenario.No this was on 2 lane highway.

meegoo writes...Does the inclusion of the moonroof in the cruiser affect the headroom like the panoramic ones usually do in other cars?I test drove the cruiser yesterday and didn���t notice any issue with headroom.
I checked out the Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. My thoughts are:1.  No digital rear view.  Deal breaker for me.  Available in US market but we missed out.  Toyota Aus probably saving it for the midlife refresh.2.  No cooling seats.  Deal breaker for me.  Available in US market but we missed out.3.

I wouldn't call it completely flat but I wouldn't call it a hump either given how small the hump is.6.  Doors close with a solid thud. Nice.Yeah, nice that Toyota is doing that. I was impressed how solid the doors are on the CH-R.
Had a look today and have to say the khaki colour on the Edge looks a hell of lot better than I expected. If I was in the market for the Edge, I'd probably go with it. The graphite looks great too.Interior looks and feels great. Plenty of room in the second row, although I found front headroom on the passenger side was compromised by the sunroof.Waiting for them to get a Cruiser AWD in stock next week for a test drive.Some interesting comments from the Dealer:When I mentioned the rear window seems small and rear vision might be compromised... "Rear vision is not that important when you have blind spot monitoring and you should be relying on it".When I asked why there wasn't Autonomous emergency braking... "Autonomous emergency braking is dangerous and won't be available on any new cars in 12 months. Pre collision warning is all you need".When I asked why Apple Carplay isn't available yet... "Apple Carplay was extremely unreliable and because Toyota means reliability they wouldn't implement it until they were happy with it".
qwerty1235 writes...What is the hump like on the RAV4?It's a big hump, like what u see on non-hybrid vehicles.
All RAV4s have autonomous emergency braking. Apple carplay and Andriod auto software will be added for free by dealers later this year.

The Toyota website reads like it's only emergency brake assist, that is, it warns the driver of a potential collision then adjusts braking pressure to avoid a collision only once the driver has pressed the brakes.I asked the Toyota salesman about it because when we test drove the Subaru Forester, the Subaru salesman drove first and sat with his legs crossed on the seat to demonstrate that the car would brake if it detected a collision without the driver needing to brake. Scared the crap out of us when he did it.Toyota salesman was adamant the Rav4 wouldn't brake without input from the driver first, hence his comments that the fully autonomous like the Forester was dangerous and would be phased out.Seems strange if it has All Speed Active Cruise Control that it wouldn't have fully autonomous emergency braking.It'll be a deal breaker with the missus if it doesn't as she wants it like the Subaru version.
JRCD1 writes...Toyota salesman was adamant the Rav4 wouldn't brake without input from the driver first, hence his comments that the fully autonomous like the Forester was dangerous and would be phased out.Geez, more and more cars are being fitted with EAB.

JRCD1 writes...The Toyota website reads like it's only emergency brake assist, that is, it warns the driver of a potential collision then adjusts braking pressure to avoid a collision only once the driver has pressed the brakes.The brochure reads that it will help with additional force but if it appears unavoidable it will apply automatic braking.I doubt it will stop you hitting a car in front 100% of the time but it will do what it can to try and stop in time.
Just dug up the owners manual. Toyota salesman definitely has his wires crossed.
Love the exterior of the car, however I still think the interior is just too busy compared to the rivals.
I was booked to test drive a hybrid today and was ready buy if the numbers squared up. Dealer called to cancel as they've sold their entire launch stock, just keeping back one non-hybrid as a showroom/demo car. Rather suggests they wouldn't have met my cost-to-change target.
WA-Surfer writes...Nope, the website shows $43,355 for the GXL Hybrid 2WD with any metallic colour other than glacier white, and $47,248 for the Cruiser.We should be talking basic "Driveaway" regarding Grades/engine (as per website)
Still seems to be a bunch left in Sydney, Although may be difficult if you have a specific colour/trim in mind. Test drove a GLX Hybrid and, while it was nice, the engine is pretty noisy even under moderate acceleration.

Agree. Second row room seems fine to me. I'm 6'1", set the front passenger and driver seats to where I wanted them and jumped in the back. Found the second row room to be good. Although, it's been a long time since I've sat in a CRV and maybe the extra leg room there is noticeable compared to Rav4.Where I found issue with the Rav4 is the front passenger seat seems to be set quite high. With the sunroof on the Cruiser I found headroom to be a problem.

Demegod writes...So, I wonder why no plug in option. I googled that it has a range of about 30km, that would do me on a lot of my day to day stuff.Dunno where you got that 30km from.For starters, these are not like PHEV vehicles. There's no specific range for EV only operation. Generally, with a full charge, in forced EV mode you'll get 1-2km and then EV mode will cancel and the ICE will start. Accelerating too hard or going over about 40-45km/h will cancel it also.If you have a full charge and you're cruising at around 60-70km/h on a flat road, backing off for a moment will drop the ICE and run on EV only (as indicated by the EV lamp in the cluster). If you gently accelerate to keep the momentum going, you'll get around 2 or 3km on EV before the ICE has to kick in when the HV battery gets low.It takes a bit of practice and a few changes to driving habits, but once you master it, you'll find your fuel economy gets better and better.
Punchcard writes...A Prius Hybrid (NiMH models) only get around 1km of range on EV mode. The Rav4 is using a similar size battery/motor, so expect it to be closer to 1km than 30km.I read on the US sites that the AWD Prius only has a tiny 7hp rear motor while the AWD Rav has a ~50hp rear motor.  I would have thought the battery would be a bit bigger than the prius to drive the bigger motors. Maybe the battery would be similar to the Camry HV, and maybe bigger for the Rav AWD. Did a quick search but couldn't find any info.

My main concern was that, my folks had a older model 2WD kluger, it has a V6 in it, and I always noticed that when taking off from the lights, I'd need to have my foot off the break for maybe an extra second or two before I put the pedal on the accelerator otherwise the wheels spin and traction is lost a bit. On my current RAV4 (09 model) it's a AWD and I never feel that problem, can always just take off without much delay. Just want to know if that's just how 2WD's behave.
user8976 writes...Just want to know if that's just how 2WD's behave.That's more to do with engine torque and a heavy right foot! With awd systems like the rav (non hybrid) you will feel the awd kick in to some extent.With the hybrid, I have no idea if they use the rear motors only for traction or if they use it in ev mode as well. qwerty suggests they might use it as a normal ev motor, not just for traction which to me makes sense.
Awd versions tested and explained:https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rWxzkY8_D3gSeemed like they put work in the vid to explain it well. Not really impressed with Toyotas implementation. Non working feature for over a year because software...wow.

Accelerating from a standstill2. Regen from brakingObviously when the car loses traction is uses the rear wheels but 99% of the time it���s FWD.I don���t keep the Energy Monitor on the screen long enough to see what happens when I lose traction, I usually just have the simplified one displayed in the instrument cluster which only shows power flow.
qwerty1235 writes...If my NX 300h is any indication on how the RAV4 also works, interestingly the car uses AWD to get off the lineThe reviews of the new RAV4 I have seen is that the car is very reluctant to engage the rear motor.off the line.  The same is true of the current CX5
qwerty1235 writes...With the Energy Monitor displayed on the larger infotainment display, I only see the rear motor used when:1. Accelerating from a standstill2. Regen from brakingThat's interesting. As an engineer I can see how that would be an easy clean solution. However if that is the case, then why bother having a electric motor at the front as well? I assumed that the electric motor at the front is a better integrated unit that had something to do with the regen from braking. NBut if the rears do that, then why even have extra electric motor at the front? Basically you are better off just using regula fwd NA motor up front and then the rear is EV. Meaning it's a 100% bolt on solution that theoretically you could retrofit to existing fwds .
I���m tossing between the Edge 2.5litre vs the 2.5litre with Hybrid. Not sure how the Hybrid will be able to take water if I have to do a light creek crossing. Will it fry the electrics? Are the electric motors located down low? Are they water immersion proof?
Calvin_wp writes...However if that is the case, then why bother having a electric motor at the front as well?I think the hybrid platform is FWD only. Toyota probably had to engineer the rear end of the car to fit the extra electric motors in. On the NX 300h, the batteries have been moved to under the rear passenger seats.

AIUI on the AWD variants there's just one motor driving the rear wheels through a differential. No doubt there's a sound reason for doing this, but my instinct would have been to have two smaller motors, one for each wheel, with the electronics feeding the power as appropriate.
DockTony writes...No, all the hybrids have 2WD/AWD options.Yes I know, obviously as mine is AWD. What I meant to say as it was my fault for not being clear enough, was that the platform was designed to be FWD first but AWD capable.I'm sure Toyota would have considered the option of having it RWD electric but for whatever reason I'm sure it was down to cost or complexity.Also, since the Toyota is a full hybrid, it can blend power from both the electric motor and ICE from the eCVT... may be a reason why it's located in the front.

Will PM dealer.@ Orkstomper, that looks like a pretty good outcome, well done. I've just started looking at the same model in Perth. Would you mind PMing me the dealer please? Thanks
For Toyota's hybrid drive it's not possible to have the engine working by itself on a different axel to the motor(s). ie front engine + rear motorAt the heart of the system is a planetary gearset. The engine + primary motor + secondary motor (yes there are two at the front of the vehicle) are all fed into the gearset. The engine needs to be restarted by these motors and the difference in speed between the engine,primary and secondary motors is what creates the 'gear ratio' within the planetary gearset at any given moment.
Orkstomper writes...$43.5k  not as good as some, WA stamp duty is higherGreat work on the price. It look like there is a price difference of $700 between NSW and WA

Anyone managed to go down the path of swapping wheels from a different model as part of the package?Realise it���s a bit cheeky of me and the dealer may not be able to do it but not a fan of the GLX wheels and would prefer the black cruiser wheels. Also understand the dealers may have to sell as a package and can���t change them over but can���t hurt in trying lolAnd no, don���t want a Cruiser. The additional features over the GLX don���t do anything for me
The new Rav4 has electronic 4 wheel drive. What does that mean?? How does that compare with Subaru���s awd?
individualist writes...How does that compare with Subaru���s awd?Subaru is all time AWD. Which means all four wheels are driven all the time.Toyota���s AWD system only sends power to the back wheels if it needs traction, otherwise it���s FWD.
There are some nice looking wheels for the GLX/Cruiser in the accessories area of Toyota's website. They are the same size (18 inch) so im guessing no need for new tyres.Trying to get the cruiser wheels for a GLX seems like a lot of trouble as they're the same wheels painted black :) The cost to change would probably almost cost the same to upgrade to a cruiser as dealer isn't going to swap things for free
individualist writes...How does that compare with Subaru���s awd?It doesn't. The AWD could have been something really great, since you have a powerful electric motor with instant torqe...and...Toyota dropped the ball completely. They fail so hard on the software font its not funny. So extreamly dissapointed. Ontop lots of negative reviews on edmunds.com, dangerous performance on km77... sigh.

I assume the original wheels and tyres would be yours to keep in any case.
I asked my dealer about upgrading to the 18" wheels. He said it would be so expensive I might as well buy the next model up anyway.

Not so sureI wouldn���t expect it to be free either, I totally get there would be a changeover cost. Will see how I go anyway
Feathers writes...From the USA? LHD are built in Canada.   RHD are built in JapanAh nice, hopefully it better quality then. A lot of the complaints also seemed to be with the auto gearbox/engine so maybe the hybrid dodges that.
mpk- writes...Will see how I go anywayLet us know how you go :) Im curious if the dealer wants to sell wheels at a resonable price or charge full price if they cant be bothered?
Driver6M writes...Let us know how you go :)Haha it was no dice. He basically said they���d be about 2k and Toyota is fairly reluctant to do it at the best of times.He gave me RRP pricing and I told him he needed to be about 3k lower. I���m happy to let this run for a couple of weeks till EOM and see what happens. They haven���t moved a lot of stock so should be interesting.
My local cant be selling much. They showed me they only had a couple of gxls coming. Then got a msg, oh we are selling heaps but we have a few left!So you sold the 2 gxls, or you didnt sell them at all? Figure it out mate
mpk- writes...Toyota is fairly reluctant to do it at the best of timeI wanted to change the wheels aswell cause I didnt like the black on red. But there would be a huge wait if you do. Might aswell buy seperate and then sell the genuine on gumtree later on.
So this new model has 4wd lock button? I watched a lot of reviews showing the different drive modes but none that can manually put it in 4wd? The modes are all reactive waiting for the one wheel to slip then apples brake to slipping wheel. Depending on mode is how much the car applys the braking.
#Tonez writes...I didnt like the black on redUser 'mpk-' wanted the black painted version and you want the unpainted version of the same wheels. If your in the same state you could just swap!! Problem solved
bobbynoway writes...I watched a lot of reviews showing the different drive modes but none that can manually put it in 4wd?I think that's typically the main difference between AWD and 4WD, isn't it? AWD basically does what it thinks it needs to do with distributing power to the wheels whereas with 4WD you can put it into 4WD mode when you want it. I'm sure there are many different systems and it isn't quite that simple, but I think that's the essence of it. I had a Subaru Liberty and there was no 4WD mode, it just drove all wheels as necessary, hence AWD.
JustinTH writes...with 4WD you can put it into 4WD mode when you want it.Older RAV4 has a button to manually engage awd which will then disengage when speed is over 40kmh. This new RAV4 seems it doesn't have this feature anymore. Replaced with an Ecu that thinks it knows best when to engage awd.

I had a look round the full range at Toyota Nunawading. I'm all but ready to buy a Cruiser Hybrid AWD, just completely undecided on colour: silver/grey/black are out, the light blue is IMO what 'Yes Minister' would describe as a courageous choice, white is cheaper and arguably safest, and the dark red and dark blue are classy ... but invisible in the dark? (though with lights on perhaps this doesn't matter?). Opinions anyone?
DockTony writes...Opinions anyone?You know what they say about opinions... lolI like the grey (graphite) as it almost blends in with the black on the wheel arches. Black is out for us as it shows dirt too easy (IMO) and scratches stand outWhite would be ok too on the cruiser hybrid, with the black wheels. Wheel arches almost blend in.
DockTony writes...Opinions anyoneThe cruiser has the choice of grey or tan interior. Tan looks great on the darker colours and vise versa. That could narrow your choices down.
Interesting about the height. We're starting the search for a mid-sized SUV and didn't have a problem with the RAV4 (in either front or rear seats) for my 6 foot 4 husband. One of our cars is a Mazda 2 and he's fine in the front of that too (or the backseat for short distances).However the Mazda CX5 was hard to get a comfortable driving position and the Nissan X-trail was an issue in the backseat for him (we need the height in the back seat due to our kids potentially reaching his height over the next 5-10 years).We've narrowed our search down to the Honda CRV, Subaru Forrester and the Rav4. We've become really keen on the hybrid idea though.

I'm looking to buy next month, hoping for EOFY bargains.  I'd shortlisted to CR-V and Forester, with Golf Alltrack as a wildcard ;-)  Now I see this new hybrid SUV and it looks exciting.I live in the country and so most of my driving is highway, generally 90-100kph with lots of bends and hills.  The spec for the hybrid only quotes "combined" fuel economy.  Does anyone know how they perform outside the city?  Is the battery of benefit at higher speed or would the petrol only be preferred?
Ouigue writes...Is the battery of benefit at higher speed or would the petrol only be preferred?I believe most of the benefit of the battery/hybrid system is lost at highway speeds/cruising.So you will have paid a premium for the hybrid and never make it up doing highway km���s.
Just as I feared.  Thanks
I think there is still some benefit. Out of the others listed I would definitely take the Hybrid Rav4. I have not driven the  Rav4 but am a believer in the drivetrain.the hybrid should give a little better highway economy, especially if you have lots of bends where the regen braking slows you down and recharges the battery, and the electric motors slingshot you out.I had a Camry hybrid and got high 5s fuel economy on the highway with still excellent overtaking performance.
Ouigue writes...I live in the country and so most of my driving is highway, generally 90-100kph with lots of bends and hills.  The spec for the hybrid only quotes "combined" fuel economy.  Does anyone know how they perform outside the city?  Is the battery of benefit at higher speed or would the petrol only be preferred?I agree with Lansing. From my previous Prius C experience twisting and undulating roads are a good fit with a hybrid. Apart from the fuel saving you'll probably never have to replace brake pads and rotors. Where there's much less benefit is on straight fairly level freeways where you're maintaining a constant speed for a long period.
Was talking with a mate who knows a fleet manager responsible for several hundred cars and they were just discussing the RAV Hybrid.They're going to buy a bunch of them as the hybrid option is working in their favour on resale, so maybe if you think you won't get every penny back on on fuel savings for the extra hybrid cost, you'll get it at sale time.
They also drive much better with the 160kw and the combined torque (that they don���t publish).Another under appreciated feature of Toyota hybrids is that they maintain speed downhill when in cruise control by utilising the regen braking
4cyl_Turbo writes...I believe most of the benefit of the battery/hybrid system is lost at highway speeds/cruising.So you will have paid a premium for the hybrid and never make it up doing highway km���s.Doesn't appear so:Having a look at the USA specs for city/highway/combined for the Hybrid are 41/38/40mpg so 5.74/6.18/5.88 in L/100k (from https://www.toyota.com/content/ebrochure/2019/rav4_ebrochure.pdf). The "highway" figure for the hybrid is still lower than the 33mpg figure for the AWD in the USA (7.12L/100km).(I'm just showing this to get an idea of the ratio of city:highway as opposed to the absolute amounts, point being that the highway figure is lower on the hybrid than the non-hybrid).
Lansing writes...They also drive much better with the 160kw and the combined torque (that they don���t publish).Electric motors have 100% torque from 0rpm, so it'll change the torque curve significantly as well, it'll feel a bunch faster off the line.  (It's why electric cars are so fun, no waiting for a petrol engine to spool up).
Lansing writes...Starts to make Camry a pointless tooUnless you want the option of the 224kW 3.5L V6 (which could have been re-introduced in the new RAV4.. It would have made things somewhat interesting..).
No. 48117 writes...Unless you want the option of the 224kW 3.5L V6 (which could have been re-introduced in the new RAV4.. It would have made things somewhat interesting..).Yeah nah. We have a current model Kluger and torque steer is a bitch with 218kw! Interesting wouldn���t be the word I���d use for a car that is a fair bit lighter with the same power hahaHaving said that, test drove a GXL fwd hybrid on the weekend. Acceleration felt similar to the Kluger, if not better. Steering seemed less responsive but it���s apples and oranges
Is there a cost for this so called battery inspection beyond the 5 years servicing? Im assuming its included during the first 5.
Demegod writes...They're going to buy a bunch of them as the hybrid option is working in their favour on resale,Itd be interesting to see their figures. Id say if you sell it before or bang on 5 years itd be good. Beyond that 6 or 7 range most buyers will be factoring in the battery replacement towards the end of its warranty.
Menco writes...most buyers will be factoring in the battery replacement towards the end of its warranty.Which will not be too much if needed at all.
Anyone in Melbourne negotiate a good deal on the GXL or Cruiser?
I did some more looking around today. Not quite ready to buy until we work out how to pay for it. One dealer was quite chatty actually and was telling me that Toyota expected about 40% Rav4s sold would be hybrids but the actual percentage since their release has been around 80%. He also said that there's now around a 4 month waiting list for a new hybrid Rav4. Not sure if this is just this particular dealership (SoR Perth).
Dwoofus writes...Not sure if this is just this particular dealership (SoR Perth).Talk to Spackbace on OzBargain, he's a salesman at one of the Toyota dealers in Perth, always upfront and honest on there. He'll tell you whether the dealer is talking rubbish or not, and personally if I was in Perth, I would deal with him only.

I was telling my local that i was shopping for the forester aswell. Similar spec people have been getting forester for 40k. They straight away said 'oh well you would be looking at comparing to the 2wd hybrid gxl, like for like'.....ah no mate, price maybe, but not specs
mpk- writes...We have a current model Kluger and torque steer is a bitch with 218kw!Hmm, something must be wrong?My Aurion has the same 3.5L V6 as the current Kluger (just with 200kW though) and I don't experience any torque steer / axle tramp unless I floor it in the wet (rare).I'd suspect with the AWD (still FWD biased I know) drivetrain, the 3.5L V6 would have been nicely suited to the new RAV4.
Menco writes...I was telling my local that i was shopping for the forester aswell.

Has anyone had any quote on insurance yet? I realise there are a lot of variables so it's a bit hard to compare, it's a pain in the ass though because the new RAV4 doesn't appear to be on any systems yet so you have to spend half an hour on the phone to someone as they do a manual quote.FWIW RAC quoted me $54.20/month with $500 excess for the GX 2WD Hybrid.I got a price from HBF as well, but I have other policies with them which change the price so it's not going to be very meaningful for anyone else.

We're also upgrading from a Subaru Outback and are similar. We never used the AWD and the only time we use the towball is for the bikerack.

#Tonez writes...Picking up the hybrid cruiser atomic rush next week! Cant waitHow exciting! This was the model and colour we test drove on launch day and hooked us in. The kids (unfortunately we had them on us as we "weren't going to test drive today" ��� ha), were bouncing around with enthusiasm and chanting "we want THIS car". Not quite the cool-headed decision I'd prefer to make. Thankfully we aren't in the position to buy just yet so had to walk away anyway :)

Was chatting to my dealer mate yesterday, basically good luck getting a specific hybrid colour unless the dealer has it in stock.I specified the red and hybrid ��� was delivered to the dealership yesterday and I hope to take it home next week. So it can happen although orders may be picking up and choices tightening. I asked the salesman where it came from and he said Brisbane, then Sydney then here. Good service.
Feathers writes...That'd be great!  Mine's the 15th August.... :-(  Hopefully there'll be good news before then though..Mine arrived at the dealer today. Pick it up Monday.  I'm surprised it's taking a while for people to take delivery. I have only seen one on the roads in Sydney (unless I'm blind)
Saw 3 new RAVs on the way to work this morning which is only a 12 minute drive (western sydney). Was surprised to see as many on the roads already, given that launch was last week. They look a lot better in the flesh.
Drove one of these yesterday. Cruiser hybrid.Amazed at the ride quality and power when you put your foot down. Was really getting pushed into the back of my seat when giving it. Very impressed with everything about it.
Test drove a GLX hybrid this afternoon (am going for Cruiser AWD). Generally very happy with the way it drove, save that there was a little more engine noise than I expected and I felt the potholes. Radar cruise control (my number one wish list option from my current car) worked well. Back at showroom, I told them my target cost-to-change and said if they'd meet it I'd sign up now and they agreed without any bargaining. I might have left something on the table, but don't think so as I was asking for the top end of trade-in value from online guide. Was easy on colour between white, red and dark blue so was happy to take the white one they're expecting next week, with registration/delivery deferred to July to fit in with other plans.
Can someone point me to the difference between a Cruiser 2.5L Hybrid in 2WD and "Electric AWD"? Does the 2WD version have both motors on the front wheels and the AWD on the rear?Nevermind:"Hybrid versions combine a 2.5-litre (131kW/221Nm) and an 88kW electric motor. For front-drivers, total peak output is 160kW and thirst is 4.7L/100km. AWD hybrids add a 40kW electric motor on the rear axle for combined output of 163kW and thirst of 4.8L/100km."
Hi mate, im from Sydney keen to buy too a GXL hybrid 2wd. May you kindly dm the DA price and dealer? Many thanks
Anybody who went for the edge? I am only seeing discussion about the hybrids.
I was keen on a AWD hybrid for awhile. I have a 18 RAV GXL AWD. A couple of weeks ago. l drove to Marree and then up the Oodnadatta track an onto to Uluru. The Rav handled the sand dunes an corrigations far better than I thought it would. 10,000 km so far on this road trip.The hybrid AWD cannot do any of that. It is all plastic underneath. No wading depth either. Shorts out the electrics. The new hybrid is more city focused than the out going modelSomething to keep in mind. If you are thinking of a AWD hybrid RAV.My Rav has the same ground clearance as the new Adventure. I have changed the header pipe on mine. Plus full size spare wheelThe Adventure would be nice, but very silly pricing.
I would think the electric drivetrain would be better off road as you don���t need air intake when wading through water. And the electric motors can apply precision traction to the wheels unlike combustion engines that need to ramp and down.Electric motors are sealed and are incredibly simple things and the battery is up high behind the rear seats.. I used to go in EV mode when crossing creeks in the Camry, didn���t have to worry about ingesting water. They were shallow and safe though and easily passable for decent sedans like Falcons and Commodores.I believe the off-road warnings in the handbook apply to both hybrid and petrol variabts and should be followed.

Even the bmw x5 forum people are happy to share their driveaway prices.... come on guys. Share some if your latest deals you got here with us newbies.THanks in advance.
Strommer writes...My Rav has the same ground clearance as the new Adventure.I believe the Edge has 219mm vs. 197mm for the outgoing model that you have.
The only downsides of the cruiser my wife could pick on were slightly less headroom, and the passenger seat doesn't have electric adjustment. Minor things overall.
ChristoShizz writes...also- just been reading the user manual for the 2019 model, specifically says not to take it off road:"-- Do not drive the vehicle offroad.

Can���t find any mention of what you have quoted in your post.
I'm renting a current model Rolla hybrid at the moment. I could never own one due to the size but damn, the thing drives beautifully. I'm very impressed and can't wait to get my hands on a RAV hybrid.
Yeah the Hybrid drivetrain and modern Toyota interiors and the way they drive are bang on the money.The latest Corolla, Camry and RAV4 make the old versions look like something developed for third world markets. Such a vast improvement in one generation change (and this is coming from someone who owned the previous Camry).
Has anyone rest driven a hybrid 2wd and Hybrid AWD back to back and noticed any difference?
Has anyone received a decent deal on the 2019 cruiser AWD hybrid 2.5l model? I���m not seeing any figures on what people are paying for these Toyota���s. I���m interested in buying this model.

I think satnav is standard for all model

Didn't know Satnav is an option on the GX.  I am not in a rush so can wait depends on if there's a good deal. Can you please pm me the dealer location where you got the gx price from. Thank you.
One dealer also told me that Satnav is optional on the GX.

That would make most of your city driving electric.
Demegod writes...I wonder why they didn't make the RAV a bit more like the Outlander PHEV with plug-in ability and about 100km rangeI believe the hybrid get a 1.6-kWh battery and would need almost 10 times that size for a 100km full electric range. So I imagine space and cost both come into that equation.
Picked up the car today. Amazing on the drive home.  Only issue is the resolution of the camera is not great. Quite blurry. Also the wireless charge is a hit and miss. Phone moves as you drive. As a result doesnt charge

Took delivery of my Hybrid 2WD GXL two days ago ��� very pleased with it.howeverThe following day I registered it on MyToyota only to discover that existing Toyota owners are eligible for a $500 loyalty reward in the form of a petrol card or extras.greatHowever, the reward apparently has to be applied for BEFORE the new purchase and here am I with a purchase just 18 hours old.moreoverOne needs to already own a Toyota registered on MyToyota. My wife's car is a Toyota Echo.

Cost and running cost aside, is there much more grunt in hybrid compared to petrol version?Petrol version should be similar to previous version 2.5l or more like sluggish old 2l?
garax writes...I have now registered both cars but the dealer is somewhat iffy about honouring it.Any comments?The dealer didn't mention about it before the deposit or buying the car? Not great customer service.But i dont think the dealership can do anything about it cause its all done somewhere else.Also the MyToyota app details need to be the same as the one you purchase the car. Otherwise its a headache if you get it wrong as i was told.Purchasing the car, you would need to register on the app + current toyota. We have a Yaris here and i added that but didnt verify cause its under another name. Not sure if it still works.But i did get an email telling me after the RAv4 is delivered, just wait and they get back to me..

So what style of driving does the hybrid help the most with? Short city driving trips with lots of stop starting at low speeds? Or highway speeds where you stay at 110 for a long time.I am assuming its the city driving so if you do a lot of kms there its the best vs someone who mostly does highway kms?
Vyviel writes...short city driving trips with lots of stop starting at low speeds?pretty much this. As you're going under 40km, you are using the battery.
Try dealer from suburb. The further the dealer from the city the best deal you can get.

Picked up our GX AWD Hybrid on Tuesday.  First thoughts.Very smooth.  Suspension is a bit floaty but corners OK. More than enough power, in fact it feels pretty quick considering its size.Driving in heavy traffic is way less stressful as it's so quiet and doesn't sit there idling.Lane keep assist borders on dangerous in heavy freeway traffic >80kmh, I've had it want to pull the car into the next lane! I suggest just leave it off unless you are country driving or are suicidal Adaptive cruise is awesome in slow traffic ��� it just follows the car in front, although you have to be aware of lane changersThe car is very chatty with warning you of traffic situations or telling you to slow down. I had to disable some of them to get some peace. Screen is not the bestTail gate doesn't go up too high so if you are over 6 foot you will bash your head into it.All up very happy with it. Feels very high tech compared to the Tucson and CX-5 we compared it to.

I think the manual states both systems work together above a certain speed when switched on.This was on the Gore hill freeway (Syd) which is several lanes wide and has cars weaving in and out of all lanes so it may have been a peculiarity of this particular roadI just find it  bit unnerving when the wheel tugs me in an unexpected direction when I'm barreling down the road. Maybe I just need to get used to it.Disabling it is easy as its just a button on the steering wheel and it's persistent. i.e. it wont turn itself back on again the next time you get in the car

Just having a look at the customisation features available, particularly those that can only be adjusted via Techstream;- Remotely wind down windows/open sunroof with fob (defaulted to off)- Lane change auto indicators (default at 3 flashes) off, 4, 5, 6, 7 flashes- Shift position linked rear wiper (default = once) off, continuous- Switching to fresh air mode when parked (default on?) off- Driving position memory fob link (default driver's door) all doors- Wiper headlight linked operation (default on) - Mirror fold locking linked operation (default off)There's a few other minor ones too. I've referenced the US manual, as TMCA has not uploaded the Australian manual on their site yet, so there may be one or 2 of these features not available. Have a look in the back of your owner's manual to confirm what's available.
Anyone know what the pixel resolution of the infotainment screen is ?I heard it was low compared to some others but it isn���t a specification that seems well publicised by any manufacturer.Anyone seen a table of them compared (eg. Mazda vs Kia vs Toyota etc) ?I realise they can vary between models but some are standardised too.
My local wouldn't budge on 40k for a GXL 2 wheel drive, auto, petrol.
if you talk to a good dealer, I am pretty sure you can buy a GXL 2WD Hybrid by adding few hundred dollars to that.
To owners of the rav4. Are you guys breaking in the car as instructed or doesnt make a differences?Been told not to drive over 80km up to 400km..
40k is the exact full retail price of a GXL petrol. They're wasting your time but you've got to play the game.Sales will be making %5 to %10 on the RRP + keeping most of the BS delivery fee.Visit or call other dealers. Know exactly what you want. Let them know you are ready to buy right now but you need them to be resonable. It's fair they make profit but don't let them keep all of it. If they stuff you around, move to the next dealer. Be patientIt's not fun. The only thing worse is buying a home

Never heard this in decades. Have seen advice to vary the running for the first 1000km ��� don���t just put a new car in cruise control and drive from Sydney to Melbourne.
if Anyone ends up getting a nutmeg interior Cruiser it would be great to see some real life photos. Hard to get a good idea from CGI renderingsIn this photo it looks quite light, but others like more yellowhttps://photos7.motorcar.com/new-2019-toyota-rav4-xlefwdsuv-8813-18490616-11-1024.jpg
Wasn't told anything about running in the engine and I had to do a trip to Sydney  (400 k's return). Obviously can't sit on 80 all the way so I made sure to vary the engine revs. Using the cruise control helps because you can sit behind slower drivers for a while then pull out and accelerate. My car is the 2wd hybrid and I was impressed by how well it revved up without extra help from me.Pleasingly the car got 5.6 litres per 100 on that run which is mostly motorway.When I went to get petrol I found a sticker on the petrol cap saying I can put ethanol/ petrol in the car ��� official confirmation.  Surprised but I doubt that I will, it runs on 91 anyway.Re the Lane Assist. It didn't try to kill me but I felt the steering to be "wooden " in that it seemed to be resisting at times. It only seems to be a problem when cruise control is also active.The vocal warnings are useful when driving in unfamiliar territory but do get wearing when driving past school after school. Red light and speed camera warnings are very useful.I was surprised to read about the "complimentary " first service which doesn't seem to include an oil change. Am I missing something here?Overall and so far I am delighted with the car.
garax writes...Pleasingly the car got 5.6 liters per 100 on that run which is mostly motorway.That's pretty good. I'm averaging 6.7 L/100Km in heavy traffic but I think it may go down as I tune my driving style and the engine is run in. Mines an AWD so will be a bit less efficient.  My Ute is 19 L/100Km so I am chuffed at the economy I'm getting in this, especially for an SUVThe vocal warnings are useful when driving in unfamiliar territory but do get wearing when driving past school after school. Red light and speed camera warnings are very useful.You can turn off the individual voice warnings in the nav settings, which is nice. You can also turn off over-speed warnings for different types of roads. I turned off the speed warnings for general roads and left them on for motorways etc. I think the speed warnings are derived from the speed limit info in the maps, which sometimes doesn't match the actual speed limit at a particular spot.I was surprised to read about the "complimentary " first service which doesn't seem to include an oil change. Am I missing something here?I think its just a general check over to make sure nothing is falling off and to look at the diagnostics to see if everything is OK. The dealer said he would just need the car for an hour.Overall and so far I am delighted with the car.Yeah, I love it. We bought it for my wife but she hasn't had a chance to drive it yet as I'm hoggin' it :)
WhatThe writes...did that come from a sales person?Different to the guy that sold me the car.

#Tonez writes...No off road driving.Like to know what Toyota consider this includes ��� we all know it is not some full blown 4WD (even the AWD version).Not sure what they are getting to with respect to sudden stops ��� other than driving style I guess.
Has anyone compared the (Hybrid) GX and GXL in the flesh? Just how much more 'premium' does the GXL feel, and does it warrant the extra $3k?The AWD GX is the exact same price as the 2WD GXL (hybrids). Is the $3k better spent on the GXL features, or the AWD?
I would stay with the GX TBH unless you care about things like 5 usb ports and 18 inch alloys and zoned airconditioning. Compared to other car manufacturers they haven't really cut a ton of corners with the bottom of the range model like how it usually has a poxy small infotainment screen etc.I test drove both and they felt very similar.That being said I am a practical buyer so I don't really care about trim and premium feel etc I have no one to impress =PIf you plan to sell it after say 5 yrs and not drive it into the ground also good to consider white and silver are the easiest colours to resell plus white saves you $600

The only feature that I'd really miss is probably the smart entry key (GX has smart start only according to spec sheet).BTW the Hybrid GX has the zoned AC, so won't be missing out on that anyway.
Yeah you are right. GL AWD hybrid (with smart start and auto AC) is same price as GXL 2WD hybrid.  So its AWD vs little things like leather steering wheel, roof racks, 18" alloys, tinted rear windows and wireless charger.I reckon forget about GXL altogether. It's either GL 2WD/AWD hybrid or Cruiser 2WD Hybrid if you into gadgets ��� only 2-3k extra depending on discounts. Leather, moon roof ��� I almost talked myself into buying it :)
I will go for the cruiser. The big 7��� multimedia information display and 360 panoramic view monitor Is the main reason why I choose cruiser. Other than that I will go for GX
That���s the exact conclusion I came to. Talked myself into the FWD Hybrid Cruiser option. Whilst there is way more kit in base spec compared to days gone by, the % $ gap between base and top spec had also narrowed a heap. Coming from a base spec 2010 Kluger and I remember thinking it was going to cost me an extra 50% for leather seats and a power tailgate.
Punchcard writes...Exactly what I was thinking. The only feature that I'd really miss is probably the smart entry key (GX has smart start only according to spec sheet).BTW the Hybrid GX has the zoned AC, so won't be missing out on that anyway.I bought the GX AWD and also test drove the GXL 2WD. I reckon the AWD has noticeably more torque off the line. I guess it should as the rear motor is rated around 90Nm. AWD also has a "trail mode" button for off-road which I don't think is in the 2WD versions. I owned 2 Mazda FWD cars before and didn't like them at all in the wet, especially over painted surfaces at intersections.There are a few interior details I noticed that depart from the GXL apart from the seat fabric & steering wheel, like hard plastic inner door handle grips in the GX, no center vent closing thumb wheel things. There's probably a few more things that I'll find as I go but they don't really bother me. GX Hybrid you have to lock/unlock the doors with the keyfob but its not needed to start the car. Visually the interior is more or less the same as the GXL. The smart entry on the GXL you still have to touch an area on the door handle to lock it. The dealer told me you cant walk away and have it lock automatically (like my Ute)The only thing I think they should have put on the GX is a better steering wheel. The plastic one is a bit too smooth and a bit cheapo feeling. Will definitely be looking into some sort of steering wheel cover
Visited a Dealership in North Queensland recently, was quoted $41,890 for the GX AWD Hrybrid (incl full sized spare).  Unfortunately that is the exact price that they have on their website...I put an inquiry through another source and was quoted ~ $40,500 to collect in Brisbane.Has anyone got a better quote on the GX AWD Hybrid, and were any accessories included?Any insight anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Just contact every dealer. Use the the offer from the previous dealer to help with your bargain. It is really luck.When one dealer needs to meet their target for the month. They most likely will give you the offer for the price you looking for.That���s what I can say. Even if I post my offer here, it won���t help if the dealer does not want to give that price.
Very lucky man

Did anyone get any offered the paint, leather/vinyl protection and the window tint? I was offered Ozoneshield from my local dealer in Brisbane and don't know whether to take it for $1800 for the lot or do it elsewhere.
I paid $1695 for the protection package and window tintOnly 7 weeks to wait for the Car.
FYI paid $49000 for a Cruiser Hybrid AWD with Towbar, Carpet Mats, Weathershields and Cargo Mat. Don't know if its been mentioned, but if towing is a consideration, be particularly careful when choosing the model, as the towing capacity's vary greatly
Even if I post my offer hereSINkaOON, please help us and post your offer. We have already waited for a few days to hear from you.
Marlin writes...$1695 for the protection packageNot worth getting paint protection. It is extra money spinner for the dealer. You cant even tell if it is put on. It is not recommended by the manufacturer.If you have to do it just do a quick search for a third party and it will be cheaper. Most likely the dealer uses the same third party anyway.
I just did a comparison of the GX to GXL 2WD petrol and when you put them together you do in fact get a bit more kit with the GXL.- Rear privacy glass- Roof rails- Premium embossed seats- Premium steering wheel and gear leaver- Electro-chomatic dimming rear view mirror- Smart entry- Push button start- 4 additional USB ports- Wireless phone charger- Reverse camera with moving guide lines-18 inch wheelsI do see the justification in a 3k difference there....Wife is coming with me tomorrow for another look. I just felt the GX to be a bit underwhelming in techy features.
Yeah the value equation does swing back to the GXL when looking at petrol models. Proximity key is such a bloody good feature in a family car.
If I'm not mistaken, going from gx auto petrol to gxl auto petrol also gets you dual zone climate control.The 3k difference between the gx hybrid and the gxl hybrid however is probably not worth it. All the items you've mentioned don't really add up to 3k imho.F55Coops writes...- Rear privacy glass- Roof rails- Premium embossed seats- Premium steering wheel and gear leaver- Electro-chomatic dimming rear view mirror- Smart entry- Push button start- 4 additional USB ports- Wireless phone charger- Reverse camera with moving guide lines-18 inch wheels

Hi allPicked up my cruiser petrol model yesterday in the electric blue colour. Just wondering if anyone is having problems with the position memory of the drivers seat. I���m doing what the manual is saying press the set button then either 1 or 2 until you hear the beep, but then once I have saved the 2 positions the seat won���t move to either position I still have to move it manually.Also does anyone know if you can install a led light bar on the nudge bar.Cheers

@Kalcat this is a well known issue regarding the seat memory. Sung in the RAV4 world forum may have a fix for this so try it before you take it into the dealer,1. move your seat forward much as you can.2. move your seat higher much as you can. 3. incline

Interested in a getting Cruiser AWD at some stage but the on quick inspection the salesman tells me it doesn���t have a tachometer, find that hard to believe, I assumed the dial on the left doubles as a tachometer. Currently drive an Aurion Presara and although the Rav4 would suit out purposes better I am a bit worried about the drop in power, very useful in Tassie. Any comments appreciated.

BCMS writes...Interested in a getting Cruiser AWD at some stage but the on quick inspection the salesman tells me it doesn���t have a tachometerHybrids don't have a tacho, it's an "energy meter". Petrol only versions should still have a tacho.
Plus a tachometer would be pretty boring in a hybrid at the electric torque kicks in down low and the electric power can contribute at the top end too, meaning the petrol motor can run its sweet zone much longer than a normal car, so not a lot of tacho action
What prices have people been paying for Hybrid cruisers? Not much info on that.I went to Sydney City Toyota today and they said they are not going below RRP for Hybrids given their demand.Have people had success bargaining?
How long does it take to get the car once paid? should I be thinking a couple of week, or more like a couple of months+ ?I 'm thinking about the hybrid Cruiser model
Depending on the color,If you  ordered the car now  about 2-3  months , some dealer 4 months
If anyone has bought a petrol GX auto, would appreciate if you could share what you've paid.Looking to buy in the next month or two, saw 33k mentioned somewhere. Not sure if thats realistic, but I'd be happy to pay that
WhatThe writes...Not sure what they are getting to with respect to sudden stops ��� other than driving style I guess.I believe It's to do with breaking in the brake pads. Treating them gently when new apparently helps with pad longevity. IIRC, conditioning the pad surface and not letting them get too hot when new.  I remember being told this some years ago. Had no reason to argue or not follow the advice, so took it easy for about a thousand K's. Pretty much my driving style anyway. Expecting to get around 100k out of the pads in my Golf 7.
livehd writes...How long does it take to get the car once paid? should I be thinking a couple of week, or more like a couple of months+ ?I 'm thinking about the hybrid Cruiser modelIf they have stock, shouldn't take that long. For me, they estimate 1 month but got it in two weeks. Depend on what colour.White (cheaper), Black and blue seem to be common based on my experience. The dealers i went to had those right away.I got the Atomic Rush/red colour and they needed to get from somewhere else. Forgot to ask.The other dealers i went to said Red would be 3 month wait..
That���s nice. I was promised a delivery on end of June. But when I gave the dealer a call. They said they have to order to manufacture mine. Have to wait till end of August to get the car..????
512k writes...IIRC, conditioning the pad surface and not letting them get too hot when new.  I remember being told this some years ago.Brake pad technology has come a long way. No need for that these days
mpk- writes...No need for that these daysProbably not. Still don't work new pads hard though. No point. Have always had longevity out of pads, so no point changing now.
If you're considering a Hybrid, pads & rotors will last well beyond 100,000km easily.
SmellyTofu writes...If you're considering a HybridCertainly am. Too early to go to full electric, so seriously looking at Hybrid, later this year, or 2020. GLX or Cruiser AWD. I do like the idea of plug-in hybrid for full electric short travel, but not many choices at the moment.

I haven't looked at pricing down here in Hobart yet. Only one dealer ��� two premises, and a few other options in the north of the state, so am interested in hearing any Hybrid pricing from Tasmania.I imagine high(ish) demand will have a bearing on any meaningful deals though.

garax writes...My local is adamant that it is not necessary.It isn't these days. VW don't want to see you until 12months/15,000k's. If the 1000k is offered it's only to check fluid levels and probably some bolt tightness, and perhaps as mentioned earlier, for any fault codes in the CPU.The engines are reasonably run in in the factory before they are installed in the vehicle body, so not much (nothing, probably) in the way of contaminates in the oil from manufacture. Although I imagine the first scheduled oil change is quite important. As they all are.I asked what price if I paid for it. She said around $230 ��� for an oil change? ��� really?any comments?Cost of labour. You could save a few dollars by providing your own approved oil. You won't save much though.

So, jumping in this forum.I ordered a Crystal Pearl GXL AWD Hybrid for $44.6k; this about about ~3 weeks ago, and still no news or even a production month set. Bit frustrated, as I was hoping to be able to use it in winter (gets rough and dangerous around here)��� I heard too due to the popularity of this model that an embargo has been put on it, so staff are unable to order one using their staff discount for some 6 months from release date.Does anyone have a reputable source or an article on the delays at the factory, and why this is? I'm not even sure if the factory is the one/s in Japan or Canada. Dealer has indicated there is 'factory delays' and could take up to 4 months, so am hoping this may be exaggerated��� On the Toyota website it states there can be up to a 6-8 week wait for it, so I'll be very disappointed if it exceeds this time frame.

Sekhmet114 writes...Does anyone have a reputable source or an article on the delays at the factory, and why this is?No, but as this is a new and popular vehicle shipped to many countries, I can imagine Australia is likely not at the top of the list for countries that have preferences. I'd also imagine Toyota Australia have negotiated a deliver number. If demand outstrips that, join the queue.I remember when the current VW Passat was launched in Europe, Australia had to wait at least 18 months. Other more important markets than us down here.I believe the current RAV4 hybrid arriving in AUS is a lot newer from Toyota city (or wherever it's manufactured) than 18 months since first production. Happy to be corrected.

Had the old hilux in for a service today and they had a few of the new Rav4���s in the showroom, have to say they looked pretty nice the size is increase is a real win win, makes me think about swapping the 2014 hybrid Camry for one for larger boot space.
The first service is generally a check up as well as give an opportunity for the owner to raise any questions in regards to the person of the car. At least that is the theory behind it.Reality is that they do the last final check up once everything is settled post delivery with a few k's under its belt before sending you on your way.

Another questionIs there any way to make the instrument display brighter? I'm thinking of the digital display in the centre which can be hard to read at times.
goodtogo1 writes...Looking at the other car threads, it seems like people are getting at least 7% discount on RRP. All these high sales leave no bargaining power with potential buyers of Rav 4.You should be able to get about 7% off the base model GX Petrol.I also wanted the CRV but since Honda seem to be lazy adding the safety features to the base model I went with the Rav4 plus it has a bunch more other features like front parking sensors etc. I would wait till Honda add the safety features or just skip it.
Shame they didn���t keep the Adventure name in the RAV4 lineup, would of made its place in the lineup more clear. Edge doesn���t really mean a lot.

goodtogo1 writes...Did you buy the GX Petrol?Yeah just got it the other day not much wait for that model.$33,700 ��� $1000 for my ancient first car from 15 yrs ago = $32,700 changeover.GX Auto Glacier White, Floor mats, Tint and Sat Nav  (Sat Nav is an option you can remove on the GX model), 12 months rego and full tank of petrol. Didnt go any other accessories or options.Would have been approx $2000 more for the hybrid.Coming from an ancient car with zero features this one is like a spaceship and the main reason I went Toyota over Honda and the other brands was the base model basically includes everything practical in the safety features and is only really missing luxury stuff which I dont need or really want =P Drives nice and smooth and very little cabin noise.Can also confirm the large back side windows appear to be tempered glass according to the writing on them and the little triangles of side glass appear to be UV protected glass so tinting might be a good idea if you are worried about skin cancer either at the dealer or elsewhere. Looks exactly the same as the privacy glass after tinting so not even sure why anyone would want privacy glass over just tinting windows when it provides less benefit.If its your first car and you dont need the luxury stuff do consider the GX base model if you want to save cash for something else more important it seems to do basically everything I need but I am not spoilt by upgrading from a new car so keep that in mind. If you wanted a hybrid the GX one did seem to have some more features than the base GX. Also if its your first car and you don't care about colours just get the base white and save $600 =P I cant talk though as my first car had to be fancy metallic blue with alloys etc but I was younger then and cars felt special =P

Dwoofus writes...Isn't Crystal Pearl essentially white?It's a tri coat metallic white. Looks great, but not good for touch-up and repair. I had a similar metallic white on a 2010 Mazda CX7. I bought it because I thought it would be easier than most metallic coats to touch-up and repair. There was a metallic silver that looked awesome. I named it terminator silver. It was stunning, but went with the metallic white because I figured the silver would be harder to touch-up/repair. I was wrong. Lol!I was told post sale that I had bought probably the hardest colour to touch-up. The CX7 was a 2 pack paint. I believe Toyota Crystal Pearl is 3 pack.Plain white if and when I purchase.*Edit* Just did a Google on Toyota Crystal Pearl. Yep, it's not a good paint for touch-up according to some panel beaters.. Plain white is the go.
512k writes...It's a tri coat metallic white. Looks great, but not good for touch-up and repairNo colour is usually, unless its one of the base colours.As soon as you go away from the base colour, its almost an entire panel that needs to be painted rather than just touch ups.
mpk- writes...unless its one of the base colours.Easier to match, but UV fading puts a cat amongst the pigeons when matching a touch-up bottle. Some panel beaters are better than others at that, as I've found out in the past.Plain white is the best. And these soft roader RAV4's will probably need some TLC down the track, unless buyers are buying them just to take the kids to school and go shopping? Oh, I forgot...

I guess its good if park somewhere and want to watch on the 7inch screen but not worth right now. I havent tried to mirror the maps yet, but dont think that would work either due to screen only works while car is on P
jacknomiz writes...To Vyviel  about GX 2l, how do you find acceleration in this 2l engine, does it struggle with 3 people and aircon on or comfy?Was fine didnt struggle off the lights and I was driving it in ECO mode also but do remember I came from an ancient car where most of the horses were dead =PI suggest you give it a test drive and I didn't have aircon on as its really cold. Was driving with 4 adults and one baby in a car seat if that helps.I am also not expecting a family wagon to be as fast as a hatchback or something like that. If I wanted something fast I would have got something like say an Toyota 86. Main reason I went the RAV4 was size fitting that many people and a baby seat reasonably comfortably and all the safety features. The fact that the 2019 model looks tons better than the last model also helped a lot.Yeah Miracast only works when the car is in park which is pretty much pointless. The Satnav is similar that you cant use it while the car is in motion but if its at a full stop even in drive it lets you enter destinations. Wonder if I can disable that "safety" feature in the sat nav because as a driver I wouldn't use it while driving but it would be useful if a passenger could change the destination without me needing to pull over somewhere.

Just test drove the GX 2wd Hybrid.Colour me impressed. Some quick thoughts:Exterior ��� looks even better in real life. The car is more ���substantial��� than I was expecting.Interior ��� I wouldn���t call it classy at all, but it seems to be high quality and put together well. In a word I���d call it rugged.Drive ��� it���s very quiet. I didn���t even notice when the petrol engine kicked in. It is quite peppy and had no issues with acceleration. Steering felt fine.Features ��� with a couple of annoying exceptions, the GX Hybrid has everything I���m after. Unfortunately it doesn���t have a proximity key for unlocking the doors (how isn���t this standard on every new car?) and although the mirrors fold in, it���s not automatic and requires a button to be pushed. What���s the point if it doesn���t fold them in automatically when locking the door?I���m still very stuck between the Rav and Subaru Forester. I like them both for different (and the same) reasons.

We're coming from a Subaru outback (15yo car though so none of the modern features beyond climate control and ABS/airbags) but I liked the Forester's looks and the large windows for the back seat. But all that aside the hybrid Rav4 is most definitely the frontrunner.
Make sure you guys check your car and tyres before picking up the car.It was dark when I picked mine up. Had the car one week already but since I play music and had the windows up most of the time. I couldnt hear anything until tonight while driving with the windows down. Hearing a clicking sound when driving. I heard that this sound before and it sounded like a nail was in the tyre.

richardJF writes...Why do you need to know?Mostly driver ego ��� why they used to put engine sizes on the boot ��� but really only needed in areas where you need snow chains (even then regulations differ between resorts), as some treat a AWD the same as a 4WD as to when chains need to be fitted.
This is not a big deal, but I noticed that there is no Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).  I asked the dealer about it.  He said Toyota were not big on TPMS.  Does anyone know why?
Having had TPMS on a Mercedes B250 for five years, I would not get terribly excited about it. Not a technology that seems to be sorted yet in varied guiss. Far better to regularly check tyre pressures with an accurate gauge

I have been test driving cars lately..the 2019 gx petrol felt sluggish, a little underpowered compared to the 2019 tucson.Am i imagining things or this is true cause even the engine sounded like it was struggling to move sometimes

I didnt feel like sport mode changed anything when testing the hybrid. Maybe slightly different throttle response. But it was so hard to tell

I must admit didn't notice too much on the test drive but then everything was unfamiliar.  After driving for a while in Eco mode you really notice the difference in acceleration. Even though its just remapping the throttle it feels much more sprightly.
mbuzz writes...i am actually thinking if i should go for the tucson or mazda x5, any thoughts?We looked these 3. The Mazda does drive the best I think, its quieter and handles better.  Mazda always seem to pay more attention to driving dynamics, and the interior was the nicest IMO. Ultimately went with the RAV Hybrid as its super economical and so nice in heavy traffic. Mazda's i-stop was a bit annoying. The 2L Tucson was gutless but the diesel was good.  Plus the Tucson and CX-5 are a few years into their production with the current shape where RAV is brand new so should have better resale. TBH they are all pretty good cars
Sbruris writes...there is no Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).We have this on our two Golfs. It's OK and will alert if the pressure drops ~4 PSI. I don't consider it a must have, as I still prefer to keep the pressure closer than 4 PSI, so will check every few weeks.On one of our Golfs I have nitrogen (Bob Jane TMart) and have the pressure checked at Bob Jane every year or so. Never had the TPMS go off on the tires with nitrogen. There are naysayers out there, but nitrogen stays in the tyres longer than air unless there is a leak through the tyre or valve. It does cost $6/tyre, so the usual response is air is free etc. I like it. But admit haven't bothered in the other Golf since having new tyres fitted. Free pressure checks for the life of the tyres, so not a big expense.Just need to let the dealer/service centre know at service time not to check the pressure, as putting air in sort of defeats the purpose of nitrogen. I've forgotten once or twice.

Slic writes...Was told to expect a 4 month plus wait?Was also told that no point shopping around for a better price as cannot keep up with demand.I think most dealers know they have the upper hand at the moment with a lot of the hybrid models due to the demand out weighing the supply / stock.If you were after a petrol model it would most likely be a different story.Check around if anyone has stock of the one you want, you may be able to score a discount from them as if the sale finalises before end of the month it will count towards their quota I think?
512k writes...It does cost $6/tyre, so the usual response is air is free etc.I fill with a blend of 78% nitrogen and then a mix of other gasses. oxygen, argon and carbon.As it is not 100% Nitrogen, but get it for free at most servos  or tyre place I go to.By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases.Seriously though, my caravan came with Nitrofilled, but made no diff. By way of tyre temps or pressures.Regarding tyres not leaking, the 20% of other gases does not make a tyre leak more than 100% Nitrogen.And regarding TPM's, I think they are a great secondary safety feature. Lower pressure with the result being more flex in sidewalls and therefore increase heat and potentially tyre failure is a great reason for TPM's.I think for those that don't regularly check tyre pressures and servos don't check as per 50 years ago, I hope they become standard equipment in the near future.The RAV4 not having the safety feature is not a deal breaker as you can always get a 3rd party TPM, but wait a year or two and I am sure it will become Std on all Toyota's.

Ricstar writes...Seriously though, my caravan came with Nitrofilled, but made no diff. By way of tyre temps or pressures.As you know, the nitrogen molecules are larger than oxygen, but nitrogen can still leak out quickly if the compromised area ��� tyre wall ��� fitting or valve allows it. So in some cases a nitrogen inflated tyre does leak just as quickly as plain old "air".  But in a well sealed tyre and a high quality valve, the tyre may stay properly inflated for a couple of years or more.I'm not sure about the temperature advantages. Maybe nothing for the average road user? But ads to the advertising etc.

Seems like in Adelaide GXL 4WD hybrids are in stock. Pity I have no need for 4WD.Cruiser delivery is in August/Septemeber.
GXL is in no mans land, feels like it���s too close to Cruiser price and the Cruiser comes with a hell of a lot more stuff.If they added one more big ticket item to GXL it would probably make more sense, e.g. leather or sunroof or a power tailgate
Lin11 I agree. The GX hybrid adds enough that the extra GXL pricing doesn���t make sense to me either.

#Tonez writes...Would the price go down as you wait?Unlikely, as you'd have signed a contract of sale. But if you lock in a trade-in price, if that's what you're intending to do then you can still use your vehicle and get the agreed trade-in price, providing you don't damage your vehicle or put 10,000K's on it.They may reserve the option to take your vehicle before delivery, and loan you a car, not necessarily a new demo, but from their used vehicle yard.Nothing wrong with that, I guess. We were given a demo a couple of weeks before delivery so they could off-load our trade-in. That was buying a new Golf in 2014.

About options selection in Australia, population is just too small here to make it profitable. Europe and US get more options.Selection process is also much more simplified here. Have you seen the list of options in Europe?While it's hard to compare due to spec difference, but Rav4 in Europe seems more expensive.

SmellyTofu writes...Is this hearsay or is it something you know from being in there?You only have to look at the respective Toyota websites.For one they have more of a range of vehicles available ��� they have multiple hybrid options too.Also, vehicle customisation options are more inclined due to their market share.Example: In the US you can upgrade to a panoramic sunroof for the XSE, Limited and Trail models.Here that's not possible, the only trim that gets the panoramic sunroof option is the EdgePlus in the US there are a range of upgrade packages available for all the RAV 4 models but there are no upgrades packages for us here.
As a warning to anyone who hates the new car smell the RAV 4 GX does smell really strongly of it so do make sure you air it out a lot after purchase and it should fade in a week or so. Just leave the windows down in the garage or something.Gave me a nice headache when leaving the dealer lol =\No idea if the other models would stink as badly might depend on the trim or seat materials too.
acacer writes...You only have to look at the respective Toyota websites.As someone that used to do this very thing for a living for this very manufacturer, it's not just a matter of "we're a 1M market so we get nothing" and consider things like commonalities in regulations, factory capacity not only overall but also within each bay to build the variations, wiring harness combinations, engineering developments considerations for the various destination etc.The last one in particular to note coz Australia is seen as a harshest destination in the world (probably eased a bit since I've left but always been harsher than US rightly or wrongly) hence you don't always get the largest wheels, the panoramic sunroof etc other markets get. All those factors are taken into considerations where the output of this are the restrictions mandated by Japan.Sure bag on the product people all you like but it's not coz of the lack of trying sometimes.
Calvin_wp writes...Australia has to minimize the range of offering due to smaller market.Why?  People are already waiting for cars to roll of the line and they can be built any which way as they come down the line.
SmellyTofu writes...The last one in particular to note coz Australia is seen as a harshest destination in the worldYup and this is the exact reason why Toyota do a LOT of testing of their various platforms out here, before anywhere else.
Mine arrived at dealer getting prepped for delivery. #soon
WhatThe writes...they can be built any which way as they come down the lineFinal build model is determined before the chassis is even placed on the line.  For efficiency, manufacturing has to have everything 'line up' as the car moves through the process.   For example, models with a sunroof to be fitted on day 3 of the process would have the sunroof in a cue potentially up to a week before hand (likely less for JIT purposes).  Assemblers / robots need the exact part to go on the exact car, at the exact time.Production manufacturing would never say 'Hey, this ones got a hole in the roof, where'd you put that piece of glass thingy?'They'd know (Toyota) days / weeks / very likely a month or more in advance exactly which model on what day and even what time the manufacturing will happen.BTW, there can never be "Delays in Manufacturing" ��� other than critical parts shortages, which in today's car industry would be avoided at all costs due to the penalties that (in this case) Toyota would make the supplier pay.  It's not worth it to any car manufacturer supplier to ever be late delivering parts.  I've known suppliers that are normally a single shift move to 3 shifts (24hrs / day) over a long weekend to avoid paying penalties.'Delays in Manufacturing' usually means that someone else (somewhere in the RHD market world) paid more than we did and they took the car that we ordered (as it was an exact match), and ours had to be re-ordered.   Commonly known as 'being bumped'.
is this hearsay or is it something you know from being in there?Just google some European Toyota sites.Here we have 3 models, each one either petrol or hybrid. If hybrid, then choose 2WD or 4WD. Plus Edge with an optional panoramic roof. Nice and easy, just how I like it :) In Europe they have some more options. Eg 2l petrol version can have 4WD, cruiser equivalent can have panoramic roof, heated steering wheel etc. I'm not saying they are good options, but would be nice to have them here, especially Cruiser with a panoramic roof. Best look at the UK site ��� no petrol, all hybrids. Cheapest just under 30k GBP.... you do the maths how lucky we are here :)Our Rav4 range is great, considering features, price, distance and demand.Look at CH-R here and compare to other markets in terms of engine especially... luckily it will change soon when they bring hybrid here.

jacknomiz writes...Look at CH-R here and compare to other markets in terms of engine especially... luckily it will change soon when they bring hybrid here.Given the demand for the RAV 4 hybrid they would be silly not to bring the CH-R hybrid and even possibly the Kluger hybrid (the US equivalent Highlander has a hybrid option)

WhatThe writes...real reason why it could not be customised at point of order ��� is there?Correct.But this turns into a 'production order' and is way back at the beginning of the manufacturing process, and not "can be built any which way as they come down the line", that's all.Once a vehicle begins it's journey down the line, it's set at that point and wouldn't be 'retrofitted' or upgraded / changed.

No, unfortunately, no accessories but you will get the $500 RAV4 rewards card to use on either $500 fuel from Caltex or Toyota accessories or 5 years roadside assistance.  I guess the only extra thing I negotiated was the metallic paint.May I ask if this is the Hybrid version or the 2.0L petrol? I was quoted from a dealer in Sydney for the basic 2.0l petrol at $35.6k, above the toyota website price :)

NRMA was about $500 with 800 excess but I have a lot of no claim bonuses and discounts.

Received a call from my dealer this morning stating that due to high demand the Rav4 might be delayed. Apparently all dealers are calling their customers who have ordered to tell them to expect further delays. Not sure what that means. I was originally told a 4 month wait at most. I ordered mine on May 31st.He also provided me with a link to the Toyota Track Your Order webpage to see where my order is at. His email included a username and password to track my order.
I got a "5 months wait" when I enquired on the weekend.
I ordered around 23rd May: have just checked the order tracker, production date has gone from "to be confirmed" to 'July 2019'
Mine is ready next week, no word of recalls.But I told them I was only buying if they could deliver in 2 weeks.
I sent my Vin to Toyota Australia, they reply back and confirmed they can���t release my car because there is a potential safety related recall on some of the new RAV4 Hybrid , they need to inspect the car before they can release it , hopefully they can fix it soon
Has anyone got a car cheaper by dealing with fleet sales people? Getting a good offer for the Cruiser Hybrid but wanted thoughts of folks on whether there is any downside of going through fleet sales.
goodtogo1 writes...Has anyone got a car cheaper by dealing with fleet sales people? Getting a good offer for the Cruiser Hybrid but wanted thoughts of folks on whether there is any downside of going through fleet sales.I ordered through my leasing company and got it for dealer cost (saving a few thousand all up including accessories ��� tow ball, tint, paint/interior protection, mats). Had another option for $2k less than cost but would have had to wait a further 2-3 months so wasn't worth it for me.I ordered the Cruiser AWD Hybrid in graphite with black interior in the end. Meant to be a June build with delivery expected by end of July/early August (missed an in stock one by 1 day). This is in Perth.
I tried but had no luck; I asked within the first week of the car being released, and the fleet people did not have the car 'in their system' by that stage ��� I was made to hunt around for my own quote, found a country dealer who did a Crystal Pearl Hybrid AWD for $44.6k.... not sure if that's much of a deal or not, but it was at least 1k+ cheaper than my local dealer, and I was desperate.
44.6k for Hybrid AWD  cruiser ?

WheelsWhat's the best mid-size family SUV?By Byron Mathoudakis, 20 Jun 2019 Comparisonshttps://www.whichcar.com.au/reviews/comparisons/2019-mid-size-suv-comparisonComing to a boilThat���s why, for the first time in over a decade, a RAV4 wins a Wheels comparison. Not by much, for the Forester���s core attributes ��� bar-raising comfort, vision, safety and value ��� remain, but the Toyota hybrid is always close behind in all these and ahead in cargo space while offering palpably better performance and even better fuel economy. When the petrol-electric Subaru arrives, the order may reverse.For different reasons, a similarly minuscule gap separates the charming Mazda and ripsnorting Volkswagen, but the CX-5 offers greater consistency. The Tiguan soars with searing speed, efficiency and packaging, but prices itself perilously close to luxury alternatives.
That was pretty much bang-on my logic in buying the RAV over the other vehicles mentioned in this article.
Hey ��� quick note for those using a fleet dealer: I live in Vic and we get a massive discount on car registration for Hybrids....I queried my fleet company and they (supposedly?) didn't know, therefore hadn't factored the $200+ discount into my quote ��� which they will now do.I do have a separate question about the $500 offer for using the MyToyota app with a new Rav4: do I need to have owned another Toyota before I get the Rav4 in order to get the discount? One of the salespeople gave me that impression, and I insisted this wasn't the case....I'm keen to spend it on the dashcam, which is in the $400 range if I recall
Had my Cruiser AWD Hybrid for a little over a month now and it drives fantastic. I called Toyota yesterday to see if mine's affected by this hybrid braking issue and was confirmed that I'm not affected. maybe it's limited to a particular batch or only 2WDs? i'm not sure.
If the subaru had the hybrid out, it would have been such a hard choice between the 2.

Vyviel writes...CX-5 is hybrid? Otherwise why wouldnt you get the petrol GX model if you are scared of hybrids =PI was getting a Toyota because it is the most reliable vehicle out there.

I am the kind of guy who buys a vehicle and runs it into the ground.Smoothcall writes...The only reason to get a RAV 4 is if you are dead set on getting a hybrid.Take away that and there are better options out there.Pretty much this also. RAV 4 has softex not leather seats, interior looks dated compared to CX-5, wont drive as well, Android auto still not there,  doesnt look as good as CX-5 etc.I passed on the CX-5 initially because of paint issues. But then, at least no one is in danger because of peeling paint.
I actually prefered the interior of the RAV4 than everything else in the same price range. As to softex that's only for the edge.But if you want assured reliability then you definitely shouldn't be buying a new model or any model that has new technology such as a hybrid.

Hi,thanks for the mad hints ��� my partner purchased a Hilux a year ago, I might be able to use his info. What are the actual 'steps' to claiming the reward though ��� I enter his VN/rego, then what is the step to prove I've now purchased a RAV4, am I needing the VIN for that as well?I ask as although my car is scheduled for production in July, it's not yet been allocated a VIN yetAnd I mistakenly said 'fleet' before ��� I meant I got a novated lease though my works Lease company; I tend to get the 2 confused (they defintely didn't have RAV4 in the fleet choice, I had to do all the hunting around and bargaining myself there)
Im told its to do with the brake booster and Toyota have given dealers an inspection check, that gets sent back to toyota to assess and they make a decision if its good to go or not.They dont know which are affected yet, so they are checking all

I ordered mine in mid May and yet they are now telling me my delivery date is in September. They didn���t make any excuses which is good just said the factory couldn���t handle the demand.I asked about the recall and the dealership told me mine will be from a revised production line so no issues. The production line tooling etc have been revised after they found the brake issues. The factory is no longer producing vehicles with faulty brakes. The sales halt was to prevent dealers who already have cars on their lots from selling those cars until they have had a thorough inspection.Not happy with the 4 months wait till September esp when my contract says August delivery.
Wrrr writes...Not happy with the 4 months wait till September esp when my contract says August delivery.Did you have a VIN assigned to your order? It seems strange to see stories like this considering they would typically know the exact production run of your vehicle build. This makes me wonder if they either hadn't secured stock originally to secure the sale or sold your car under you for a higher price.I've got a batch code (ordered 24/5) and production due this month with a delivery in late July or first week of August depending on shipping. I'm in Perth so assume ours arrive quicker than Sydney etc. I'm still waiting on my tracking information which should arrive this week.

There are issues with the RAV and depending on which production line run you get, some faults will remain. Make sure you check your car when you receive it for the faults below, and do kick up a fuss at the dealership if you have one of these issues:http://m.carcomplaints.com/Toyota/RAV4/2019/
I have added the following clause in my contract, will it be sufficient?"As per phone conversation with G***y, the deposit amount is fully refundable if car is not delivered by end of September 2019 "

This is regarding the Edge, not the Hybrid. Don���t need to take it with a grain of salt. Once you drive the car you���ll know for yourself.I must say having test driven the Edge, it is very loud.

The point is, this is not a diesel, yet it sounds louder than a conventional diesel. If you���ve already test driven it and happy to live with something like this day in day out, then all good.

Have you test driven the Edge yet? If not then you don���t know how severe it is for an over 50k petrol model.
It's a high-comp direct injection engine, it's bound to be noisy
Nah mate, trust me. It���s noisier than that ��� it���s not the engine only, it the combination of the noisy engine and noisy transmission combined to make this gravelly sound.
When I first did a test-drive I also thought the engine was raucous under acceleration. I bought a GXL Hybrid anyway because of all the other positives about the car.Having driven mine over 2000k's now I can say I love driving it, I highly recommend the hybrid model and I don't even notice the engine noise. On the other side of the balance it is usually remarkably quiet. I still haven't got used to total silence when I first start it or when waiting at traffic lights.Another positive: there are so many features through the infotainment system that can be adjusted to your taste, I'm still discovering them.
@garax : How���s the drive on freeway(90km/h and above), any annoying loud engine noise or road noise in the cabin?
Road noise is as it is with any car. If you're driving on a road surfaced with bitumen/gravel there is some noise from the tyres ��� not the engine. On smooth bitumen no problem ��� the use of gravel with the bitumen always causes noise.The engine displays noise when you accelerate hard ��� as someone already said ��� you get that with any car.Road noise is no worse than any car that I've ever driven.
Mate without practical experience driving the Edge all you���re saying now is just theoretical heresay. Drive the car first then you might sound credible. Have you driven the car?
The hybrid cruiser is beautiful. The edge is substantially noisier with outside noise intruding into cabin
"Mate without practical experience driving the Edge all you���re saying now is just theoretical heresay. Drive the car first then you might sound credible.

Lol ���  I���m sure we all need a lesson about driving a GXL Hybrid for 2000+k���s ��� this is coming from someone who tries to educate people about ���an engine displaying noise when you accelerate hard��� ��� are you serious about those comments? I���m sure we all know that already.
Wrrr writes...The hybrid cruiser is beautiful. The edge is substantially noisier with outside noise intruding into cabinGo whinge to Toyota thenHonestly, I doubt anyone cares you have a bee in your bonnet about the Edges engine noises etcDon���t like it, don���t buy it and find something else?
That grinding noise is more of a Grrr than a Wrrr :)Yes, even the ICE engine on my Hybrid Cruiser sounds rough, but I can't help but wonder if it's just the contrast from the smooth nothing of the electric motor, then bang... you're hit with what feels like a tractor motor when accelerating.I think the contrast can be quite jarring, but there's no such excuse for the Edge model, which by all reports is quite agricultural by modern standards.... (disclaimer: I haven't driven the Edge, and don't intend to)
"So, a quick update:My webtracker 3-4 days ago showed a production date of July: I check today and now that has been replaced with""Latest Estimated Customer Delivery Date:	06/08/2019 12:00PM""This is GREAT news!! So excited!!!  I might actually survive this Winter's horrendous roads ;)"
Foghorn17 writes...it's just the contrast from the smooth nothing of the electric motorThat's basically it. If you go from a fully electric car to an ICE one they are so much louder no matter how good the engine =PAt least we know the future will be nice smooth and silent in a few years when fully electric vehicles start to roll out in larger numbers.
What did others compare the RAV4 against?
Berj writes...What did others compare the RAV4 against?CRV and Xtrail and Forester etc. All the compact SUVs are quite similar
Sounds like a bit of variation in wait times, depending on hybrid, AWD, colour, Grade and location. I ordered a Glacier White AWD Cruiser Hybrid on 17 May 19 in Wollongong.  Was told 2 days later that delivery is likely around Jul/Aug.  Got a call from dealer today to confirm that production date is 1 Jul and should arrive on boat at Port Kembla on 20 Jul, then add 5 to 10 days to get to dealer for pick up.   Irony is that Port Kembla is only 10-15 minutes from Wollongong.  I asked Dealer if I could track it ��� he wasn't sure.  Not too fussed about tracking it ���  I am pleased that it is on the way.
Generally time from ship docking to ready for transport from the docks averages around 4-5 days ��� can be quicker, may take longer, allow a day for transport to Dealer ( even though only 15 minutes away, there are many vehicles going to dealerships so dependent on transport loading and availability ). Allow a couple of days for Pre delivery at the dealership, fitment of any accessories and final detail ��� again the dealer is getting ready many vehicles and the 5-10 day estimate from boat docking to you picking up is a pretty fair estimate
I test drove the Cruiser AWD Hybrid, i found the car to be noisy , if you minus the engine noise,  even then you still get a lot of tire and wind noise in the cabin.And if you accelerate fast then there is the engine noise as well.i am now thinking of test driving the petrol version and also will try Mazda CX5 .Has anyone test other compact SUV and found the noise in RAV 4 comparable?
You���ll be disappointed if you drive the Petrol version. It is even louder ��� ssshh, there���s a few here who gets offended by comments of a noisy petrol version.The CX-5 is a great drive, but even though it is nice inside the cabin, it is a generation behind in terms of interior design compared to the RAV4. Also there is no dedicated central locking button. It is also a stiff ride.
Thanks
Yes mine has been confirmed for pick up this Saturday.I ordered GX petrol CVT version. All up $33k drive-awayManaged to get sky silver colour too.Hey, thanks for posting, this is the cheapest I���ve seen for GX petrol auto with paint.

We were tossing up between a new x-trail or a new Rav and took both for a test drive.The x-trail ticked a lot of the boxes but I found the positioning of the foot brake very annoying and had to walk away from it.Then tried the Rav. Very happy with it and even talked the dealer into taking it on their 4wd track (nothing major but they took a lot a convincing) and the car handled it with ease.Picked up the GLX AWD in light silver with full sized tyre, roof racks, tow bar, floor mats, boot mat, privacy windows, tinting and paint protector for $45,500.Got the car within two weeks and love it :) 900kms to a tank ��� but agree with some of the other comments, we had to turn off the warnings, as they were getting very annoying (especially the school ones when schools were closed).David

Yes, a very good price. My wife is the negotiator and went low, with the expectation we would meet half way. But they agreed with the price!!They didn't say anything about it being difficult to get the full sized tyre ��� other than we lose the ability to drop the boot shelf by about an inch ��� which for us didn't matter.We basically turned off all the voice warnings ��� yes, through the nav system. Not sure how ��� wife played around with it for a while and worked it out.We didn't go with the base model as we couldn't get the roof racks and didn't go the cruiser, as we didn't want the sunroof ��� so went in between :)
Is anyone���s car affected by this brake issue?  Dealer is still holding my car , Toyota Australia won���t allow them to release it ,   Has been nearly  2 weeks , no update from Toyota
My dealer said it���s related to a brake booster and only affects some RAV4s. Dealers need time to go through and inspect all and complete paperwork.

Inside the booster assembly is the accumulator. I believe semantics aside we have provided a reason for the sales stop to the initial query.

I have a GX where they were meant to remove the nav as I negotiated the price without it but they seem to have accidentally left it in there lol.The sounds aren't terrible as it has been making my wife a safer driver by constantly scolding her about sticking to the speed limit or that she has entered a school zone. No plan to disable it hahaI also like the lane keeping beep =P
Can any one who has a Cruiser or Edge comment on the sound quality of the JBL 9 speakers premium audio?  I took a Forester 2.5i-S (with a 8 Harman Kardon speakers, subwoofer and amplifier) for a test drive and listen ��� I was most impressed with the clarity, smoothness and bass in the system.  It was crystal clear with low, mid and high frequencies, even at the highest volume.  I read a few reviews of the USA RAV 4 premium audio, which has 11 speakers and 800 watts and gets great reviews.  I have not been able to find much on the sound quality of the Oz version.

At worst, it sounds like a quiet diesel and I love that little extra bit of noise. Gives it an off-road kind of feel and the acceleration is off the charts, compared to the previous gen AWD that I owned. It���s the direct-injection (dynamic force) engine that makes this extra noise.
Sbruris writes...Can any one who has a Cruiser or Edge comment on the sound quality of the JBL 9 speakers premium audio?As sound quality is very subjective I would personally just rock up to the dealer and ask if you can play some music in one of the demonstrator vehicles. Don't see why they would have any issue with that. Bring some of your favourite test music tracks that you use for testing sound quality and play them via your mobile or just listen to the digital radio the car comes with and some ABC classic FM.The stereo in the GX sounds awesome to me =P
I guess that sums it all up if you say it has a ���off-toad��� type of feel. Sounds more like it.
Curious ��� are people seeing much of a discount off RRP for Cruiser AWD Hybrid?
Not explicitly, but they agreed to my suggested cost-to-change without argument, which valued my car at the top end of the online 'what is your car worth' calculator: I printed out the numbers and took with me. Now waiting until Aug 25th :(
I would not be expecting too much discount, given the overall demand and concentration of that on the AWD Hybrid. However, some negotiation is worthwhile.  Comments through these posts imply discounts of about $1K-$2k are plausible.
MMC writes...Curious ��� are people seeing much of a discount off RRP for Cruiser AWD Hybrid?I got a quote on PDF for $45.8k incl Crystal Pearl (NSW). When waiting times are down, I'll go back and order one.

Yes, DA with nothing but just white number plates.... didn't really twist anyone's arm but I did have a good chat with the sales guy given I used to work at head office reminiscing when the Toyota Sales and Marking arm was in Caringbah but they have no obligations to give me any discounts since I'm no different to anyone else here walking in off the street. Plus there is a 5 month wait so there wasn't much point to do the talk and add to their order bank.

I reckon if you're not desperate to be in the queue, then wait until waiting times come down hopefully by the end of the year. Say for example the queue goes down to a month or 2 in 5-6 months time, the bargaining power will swing back to the consumer.I think close to $46k albeit great right now if wait times are relatively short however, come 5 months time, it might not be as "great" as it sounds now.
I don't understand how they gave you 3k off without even starting negotiation. Must have been keen to sell end of month.

The price I payed  for the cruiser AWD  HYBRID was $46210.My family has bought 4 cars in the last 2 years from the same dealer.
Thanks.  I had a listen at the dealer with a few favorite tracks via android phone and USB stick.  Sound quality is indeed subjective.  By my ears it was very good ��� better than my subaru outback 2018  2.5 premium but not quite as good as the Forster 2019 2.5i-S.  Clarity was great at all volumes but I would have liked it go slightly louder.  I asked Toyota what was the wattage of the system, knowing that the US version has 11 speakers and 800 watts.  I got this reply today...."Thank you for your recent contact with the Toyota Guest Experience Centre regarding a 2019 RAV4.  We appreciate the opportunity to assist with your speaker system wattage enquiry. However, upon investigation we have found that regrettably this is not a specification we hold in our systems and thus we are unable to provide this information".I am partly surprised that this info isn't available.  Should have twigged though because it wasn't mentioned in any oz specs or advertising.  Of course, the 'ears' and 'not specs' are the best guide.  Look forward to getting mine at the end of July to test it out more.
Sbruris writes...Sound quality is indeed subjective.  By my ears it was very good ��� better than my subaru outback 2018  2.5 premium but not quite as good as the Forster 2019 2.5i-S.Sound quality is indeed subjective. But in a car there are a lot more factors at play than just speaker wattage and clarity. You have to consider speaker placement, attenuation, NVH which affects sound and a lot of other factors. Even the finish of the surfaces makes a huge difference (one of my family's cars sounded completely different when we took a dash mat off!).They probably don't have specs because people who care will probably change out the speakers ��� it's not hard or expensive if you care about it and the quality jump is huge.

Exactly right, as an owner of three ex-rental vehicles which were purchased with between 30k and 60k on the clock, I can testify that each has had no major issues and each has gone onto to provide over 100k of additional happy motoring. Sorry I don't buy into the someone drove it and broke it argumentGood for you.
To those cross-shopping against the Forester:If you want petrol only: buy the Forester. It's a 2.5L with permanent AWD vs. the Rav4 with 2.0L with FWD.If you want Hybrid then buy the Rav4: when the e-Boxer Forester arrives it will use a smaller 2.0L engine and single electric motor rated at 12kW vs 2.5L with 2/3 electric motors totaling ~88/120kW depending on whether or not you go AWD.Personally I'm torn between higher ground clearance and a much more capable AWD system in the Forester, and the sheer acceleration, more modern interior/exterior and lower running costs of the AWD Hybrid Rav 4.

But felt id rarely go off road, so didnt see the need for the forester. I do like beach driving but hate the corrosion. So the rav was the pick with the better ownership costs and more power for the highway.
I want to like the Forester, but why did they make the new model look so dated, looks 5 years old already. But I suppose there is some certain level of attractiveness in cars that are functional and utilitarian.

I'm the proud owner of a Forester 2.5i-s, purchased essentially because we needed a car and the RAV4 wasn't out yet.Our other car is a 2012 Camry Hybrid. I dearly miss the Hybrid drivetrain when driving the petrol forester although in every other way I have no regrets.Completely agree with the comment above though that if you want petrol, go the forester.

Turns out after informing the dealer that I will come to pick it up instead since I don't want too many kms added on the car, he kindly advised me that the car already had some 120km on it since they don't have a demo, they have let some people use it for test drives.

If the dealer didn't have another car, that sure isn't your problem.I'd be absolutely ropable.On the bright side, I'm picking mine up this afternoon...

He is trying to see how far he can push. Because of the kms and also what he used the car for, it is no longer a brand new car. It is a demo.Do you want a demo for a discount? If so, ask him.

If you want to get technical a car can have a lot more than 120km on it and still be considered "new" if it has never been registered before.Was silly of him to admit they used it as a demonstrator should have just said it had to be driven from another dealership 100km away =P
Vyviel writes...Was silly of him to admit they used it as a demonstrator should have just said it had to be driven from another dealership 100km away =PThen it would be used, 120km on a brand new car is totally unacceptable.  If it was 100km away they would use a truck to bring it.Anything over 20km I would be questioning and if I didnt like the answer I would either ask for another car or heavy discounts.
Wrrr writes...If the dealer won���t budge on either option above, you have a right to cancel your contract and get a full refund.This would be fine but realistically the buyer has waited and if they cancel now they may need to wait another few months.

There's also a cooling fan for the HV battery that will kick in if the HV battery is doing a lot of intense charge in/out work (eg. steep mountain climbs/descents).
Yup and one of the main issues with any electric vehicle is without a petrol engine running its very easy to hear every creak and noise a car body may make which is normally concealed by the loud engine noise. Must be a pain in the bum for the engineers trying to design the body to have a quiet ride with no petrol engine haha.
Has anyone here been able to receive their myToyota Online tracking activation for their order? I'm being given the run around by the dealership and Toyota Customer Service who are all giving me different information from it's only for the Kluger to only for the CHR and screenshots of their brochure not specifying specific models (and their customer service checking with team leader who says it's all cars).

At the risk that they decide to keep it as a demonstrator and the OP has to wait 4 months for a new new one.
Thank you everyone for your input.After lengthy discussion with the manager, they agreed to cancel the contract and refund my deposit.

If the dealer is not happy to accept this then ofcourse there will be no deal. I���m not saying you have to do this, but this is an acceptable method if both parties are willing. I did this once at the protest of a dealer but I told him if he wanted the sale then that���s the condition and he finally agreed.Good on you for walking away from a deal that you are not happy with.

Then they all said hang on we can check and sure enough some cars are available. The first issue is that most will be AWD and second is they are not going to give a big discount because cars are in demand (max I got is 2k off drive away website price).

As the car is 3 hours away, dealer has offered a permit however after talking to the rego office, I think that I can register the car then bring the plate there to pick it up. Is this risky anyhow?Personally I prefer register it first as insurance is in place then and it is kinda feel better driving 300km home with a registered plate than a permit.

After a few months I started to think it does that all the time and nothing bad has happened to the car yet.
Dealer can register for you or you can register by yourself. If u do so yourself you can choose from a wider range of numbers. Just make sure that if you sign anything, you must place conditions on it to safeguard yourself.
Hi Jason. Assuming the system hasn't changed in the last 12 months and I don't believe it has, Web tracking relies on 2 pieces of information and one action by the dealer. You need the batch number from Toyota Australia (TA) and the retail sales order number that the dealer creates on TA's computer system. Once created the dealer has to then flag the sales order for web tracking. The sales order and the batch number are the user code and password. The web site is https://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/. The problem occurs when vehicles are in short supply. Dealers tend to not create the retail orders until they have confirmed production.  They don't know exactly how many vehicle by grade & colour etc they will get from a particular months production until production is confirmed. (this occurs around the 3rd of the month for the next month ie August Production, September arrival should have just been confirmed). A dealers allocation is based on a "fair share" system taking into consideration their sales history, market share, Prime Market Area volume and the mix of grade available from TMC Japan. Just because a dealer has an order from you for a vehicle there is no guarantee they will get it from TA. That's when they swap with other dealers. If its before the vehicle arrives on the wharf it's a paper swap and after that a physical swapping of vehicles. Also if a dealer is only getting 5 vehicles and has 15 retail orders which 5 will he fill this month? My bet would be the ones with the biggest profit in them or "loyal" repeat customers. Web tracking is only useful for an order on production or on a ship. After that all it will show you is that it is at the dealer.
https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/2019-medium-suv-comparison-test-119300/'Running costs are an obvious issue for any budget-conscious family buyer. Although close, there were fine-print differences here that saw the Kia Sportage and Mazda CX-5 (on 14.5 points) take a shared one-point win over the Hyundai Tucson and Toyota RAV4 (with 13.5 points each).'Very confused how the rav has the worst rating for running costs.

Thanks, I have the batch number, order number and even the VIN. Production occurred end of June and just waiting on the ship to leave Japan. My issue is that the dealer have no clue about the Web tracking system and say it will only work for the CHR car and not RAv4 which seems strange (especially after the Toyota Australia service said it does all vehicles now). According to their own materials on the system it is now meant to show on the ship, arrival into Australia and finally on truck to dealer (Perth so about 20mins from the dealer). It would seem their system is either useless if only one model is able to be tracked or the dealer and Regional training mgr are clue less.
This might sound silly but where do you find the settings to turn off the school warnings? I cant find it anywhere in the manual...

My dealer has confirmed that 'RAV4 Hybrids cannot be tracked through the Toyota app'
35km is fine though I assume you are not adding anything extra to the car as that will add extra km as they will need to drive the car to the tint place or any other place to install your extras.
Hi Jason. Sorry I should have checked on your location. Western Australia is different. ��� It has an independent Distributor (TWA) with it own computer system ��� Not Toyota Australia. To the best of my knowledge web tracking does not work and never has for WA deliveries. If  you have a batch number the dealer should be able to tell you the ship name and the port ETA. You can then track the ship on web sites like marine traffic ��� https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:162.8/centery:-13.2/zoom:3. From memory ships leave Nagoya every Friday night for Australia with 2 ships per month for WA . Steaming time was 19 days then allow 3 days to clear wharf and then 1- 6 days for off wharf processing and a further 1- 3 days for delivery to a metro dealer. If you have a VIN then it means it is already on a ship. (Up until that point VINs will not have been allocated to an order on production). I have tried to keep it simple but  as you can see there are lots of variables in the shipping process so Dealers are very reluctant to give a firm ETA ��� (Under promise / over deliver) . There are at least another 7 to 10 factors that can effect delivery times even before you throw in things like bad weather, port congestion, strikes etc. WA Dealers do get real time status updates as it moves along the supply chain.
Hi Robin. I think there is a misunderstanding on terminology. Web tracking is not available through the My Toyota app. There used to be a link from the toyota.com.au web page to the "Track My Toyota" web page ��� I don't see the link anymore. If you google "Track My Toyota" this page will come up. https://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/. It definitely was working a month ago when I tracked my new corolla. This function was developed around 2004 and I suspect I lot of new stock controllers/ sales managers are not even aware of the facility or how it works.
Wife test drove the Cruiser today ��� she rang me to say that streaming Spotify via BlueTooth sounded very tinny. Radio was fine. Anyone had this? I wasn't there to have a look.
Thanks for the great info Pradopete! Shame it doesn't work but will just need to be patient ;) I had thought of using marine trackers as well so glad I'm not the only nerdy one who thought of it lol
If you google "Track My Toyota" this page will come up. https://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/.Yes, that is the site that I asked about and was told that is did not work for the RAV4 Hybrids
How many km can you drive on a full tank of fuel in a cruiser hybrid?
900ks. Ive averaged 5.3 for the first tank. 5050 town and highway.Id be impressed if anyone can get in the 4s, have to be 90% cbd car.

I���m interested in a hybrid, and I have a few questions:1. is it worth getting the AWD model for $3k more? 2. Does it get more power and torque than the 2WD/FWD model, and accelerate faster? I read that the AWD has 163kw and the 2WD/FWD has 160kw, but torque is not mentioned. The extra towing capacity of the AWD is not important to me, the most I will do is carrying some bicycles. So it doesn���t seem worthwhile paying  $3k more for AWD if it doesn���t go any faster.3. What is the difference between the reverse camera in the GXL and the one in the GX?4. Is it worth getting the GXL?Trying to decide which model is the best buy,  thinking of a 2WD GX or GXL. There is a $6k saving by getting a 2WD GX hybrid over a 4WD GXL.
Brissie writes...I���m interested in a hybrid, and I have a few questions:1. is it worth getting the AWD model for $3k more?I bought a GX hybrid AWD and drove the GXL FWD hybrid at the dealers. I couldn't really tell too much of a difference between them driving normally but I didn't drive them back to back. My AWD does really get up and go when you plant it though. The best thing is for you to test drive yourself. I chose the AWD because I thought it may be safer and better to drive in wet weather. I had a couple of FWD cars before that would spin the front wheels easily when taking off from lights in the wet and up steep hills.  I read Somewhere that the rear motor in the AWD is 40kW so I guess it must add a bit of torque3. What is the difference between the reverse camera in the GXL and the one in the GX?The GXL has guide lines that move with the wheels i.e. to show your trajectory. I find them confusing but I think you can turn them off. GX has fixed guidelines.4. Is it worth getting the GXL?GX has a few differences not listed in the spec sheet (not sure they are in the GXL or Cruiser but definitely not in the GX such as ��� black plastic interior door handles, no center vent closing thumb wheel thingys, no coin tray in center console (!), no boot accessory socket. That's about it from what I can see apart from the obvious things like leather steering wheel, keyless entry & privacy glass etc.  GX Hybrid also gets the climate control and keyless start, so its not all bad.You need to work out whether the $ for the extra bling is worth it. All of the safety features & tech are pretty much the same across the range so I didn't really see the value in spending the extra money. With a newborn on the scene we just wanted a good safe modern car. The wife is generally doesn't care about cars and is pretty hard on wheels & body panels so would rather spend the money on something else.
https://autoexpert.com.au/posts/2wd-vs-awd-how-to-choose-the-right-suvIf you do mostly city driving and do not off-road, save your money.

Gamilon writes...The wife is generally doesn't care about cars and is pretty hard on wheels & body panels so would rather spend the money on something else.Sounds exactly like my situation haha Also why I went the GX as it has all the safety features and why I skipped the Honda CRV and other similar cars.
Thanks for all the replies.I think the GX might be all that we need, as the extras on the GLX are not that important to me. I will probably add a tow bar to carry bikes. Just still not sure if we should go with the AWD. I know that there is an extra electric motor on the rear wheels in a AWD, just can���t find any info on whether that translates into better performance, or it only works when there is a loss of traction in the front wheels. May be worthwhile to have in the unlikely event that I need to tow a trailer.Will go to a dealer to have a look over the next few weeks.
Brissie writes...Does it get more power and torque than the 2WD/FWD model, and accelerate faster?Yes. There is separate electric motor in the rear which kicks in during acceleration. Youtube videos seem to place 0-100km/h for the hybrid AWD in the low to high 7's, whilst the FWD is high 7's to low 8's, roughly half a second slower.This coupled with better traction on loose and/or slippery surfaces plus the extra towing make it worth the extra money IMO.If however you're just going to drive it like a hatchback then probably better off saving the money.
Anyone notice the drivers foot rest doesn't feel solid. In any old car if there is a foot rest it will be a solid piece of plastic but the one in the RAV feels squishy and squeeks. Apart from that everything else is well built. Anyone else notice?

Anyone else notice?Drivers foot rests have resulted in many severely broken legs during crashes.Modern drivers foot rests (if they're even present at all) are designed to collapse in the event of a crash. Theoretically if you stomp on it really hard this will cause the same result.The same principal is applied to the steering column so you don't get impaled.

Heck all the car purchase paperwork calls it a wagon =P
Vyviel writes...Yeah I am not sure why people need a SUV that they can floor off the lightsBetter acceleration also translates into faster and therefore safer overtaking on highways when road-tripping with the family.It also translates to better grip when accelerating from a standstill and out of tight corners in the wet.Likewise less chance of losing control on gravel and less chance of getting bogged when pushing the limits of soft-off-roading (which can also apply to school and sport pick-up/drop-off in muddy/sandy/mulched ground after jumping a big curb that others couldn't/wouldn't to find a place to park).SUV's definitely have a different use-case to hatchbacks if you get one with decent clearance and AWD: They become more than just a heavier and more expensive version of the hatch they're based on but with a taller driving position. They start to bridge the gap between 4WD wagon and hatch (which was originally the whole point of them).
Vyviel writes...Yeah I am not sure why people need a SUV that they can floor off the lights without too much wheel spin if that's what you are after you should get a hot hatch lol =PDon't need to floor it to get wheelspin off the lights in the wet.

ABS and ESP/ESc are far more important

I am not concerned about the safety aspect and I don���t believe AWD is necessarily safer than FWD.
richardJF writes...It's been demonstrated that the RAV4 AWD system does very little during hard acceleration from a standing start.That was the previous generation.This generation is infinitely more effective (because the old one did virtually nothing).Check out the Youtube page which does "roller tests". They do a back-to-back comparison of the old and the new. The 2019 hybrid AWD is able to climb out of 2x front wheel rollers using the rears (whereas the old model couldn't). You can also see the rears spinning almost all of the time at a similar speed to the fronts when they put the rollers on the sides (whereas the old model didn't even spin the rears most of the time).There's another Youtube video showing how the system works when accelerating at speed around a gravel corner. The hybrid doesn't provide as much power at the rear as the mechanical AWD equipped "Edge" version, but it still is noticeable (unlike the previous version).AWD doesn't provide any extra driving safety in onroad situations.This is completely wrong. Simply put, for the same level of torque output, AWD vehicles have less torque going to any individual wheel, which means it is harder for that vehicle to break traction and potentially lose control during acceleration. Yes ESC/ESP/TC will intervene is such a situation, but sometimes that's too late.FYI I have owned both a FWD turbo vehicle and full-time AWD turbo vehicle. If I tried to accelerate out of corners in my FWD as quickly as I used to in my AWD I would be leaving the road, even with all of the various systems doing their best to keep me on it. They can only do so much.
Looking to buy a Cruiser 2WD Petrol, what is the price I should ask for?Or it is better to wait for the Hybrid one, but looks like the delivery time is over 3 months.
Are we talking about a Rav or a performance vehicle?If only do city driving and got money to throw away buy the AWD version.Take a 2wd and AWD for a spin... you will notice nothing different in the way it drives. 0-100 times are both 8 sec.
Viper writes...That was the previous generation.This generation is infinitely more effective (because the old one did virtually nothing).I also saw a youtube where he took it offroad. From a standing start in the dirt all 4 wheels were putting power down. And was powersliding around a corner, so newest model seems to work a bit better sending power to the rear.
Forza writes...Take a 2wd and AWD for a spin... you will notice nothing different in the way it drives. 0-100 times are both 8 sec.Planning to do that, but if this the case then most likely I will get the 2WD.
Anyone bought one with nutmeg interior?My current car is black leather so looking for a different interior colour for a change. But I have kids so not sure if it will look more stained after a while.Looking at getting cruiser hybrid AWD. Need AWD as we go to the snow every year for skiing.

Here is a new video about the hybrid awd.https://youtu.be/Vdjb8CrAA6w
I like the two tone paint work with the black roof, wish we had that option.On another note, how long does it take after a cold start before the car can be powered by the electric motor alone? I have read that if most of the trips are very short (less than 5 km), there is not much fuel saving with the hybrid when the engine and fluids are still being warmed up.
Brissie writes...I have read that if most of the trips are very short (less than 5 km), there is not much fuel saving with the hybrid when the engine and fluids are still being warmed up.The fuel use on a petrol engine would be pretty horrendous too for 5 minute only trips.
You probably couldnt charge the battery often enough for 5km trips. A plug in hybrid would be better for that
Brissie writes...I have read that if most of the trips are very short (less than 5 km), there is not much fuel saving with the hybrid when the engine and fluids are still being warmed up.Thats a good reason to just pocket the $2000 extra a hybrid costs and stick to the petrol model. That money should cover any extra fuel costs you had over the next few years. How many km do you do a year? maybe 5000?For really short trips you need full electric or a plug in hybrid to be worth it.
Enjoying the thread, but hard to find any WA pricing people are getting :)
Vyviel writes...How many km do you do a year? maybe 5000?Actually more than that, 13000-14000 I think. Some trips will be longer, few days a week in peak hour stop tart traffic to and back from work, about 8km each way. Also many shorter trips though.  My wife is in and out of the house very frequently.I also like the fact that the hybrid has more power than the petrol model.
Forza writes...0-100 times are both 8 sec.Explain this then:Both videos get ~7.5s. And there's plenty more examples.

I have read that if most of the trips are very short (less than 5 km), there is not much fuel saving with the hybrid when the engine and fluids are still being warmed up.Camry hybrid owner here.My answer is that it depends on how cold it is and how hard you start driving straight away. If you start the car then hop on the freeway it is going to be warmed up pretty quickly. This is a very non technical view but I think most cars like the temperature gauge to sit at 50%, whatever that may be, and the software will control the car to cool or heat to keep it sitting there.Keep in mind though that the process of warming up itself will generate electricity which is stored in the battery and which can be used by the car later, so you get a loss when you transfer the energy from Organic (Petrol) via combustion to kinetic  and via generation back to electrical, but the energy after that percentage loss is used by the hybrid system later (with another loss when it is transferred to kinetic energy via the electric engine)The Hybrid wont be powered by electricity only until the car is comfortable that it is sufficiently warm AND the desired acceleration is low AND there is sufficient or excess energy in the battery.

This was the first time it had been turned on that morning (we rocked up at 8am) and the minimum that morning was 6 degrees.
Viper writes...Explain this then:Both videos get ~7.5s. And there's plenty more examples. The AWD version is generally ~0.5s faster.It���s quoted that the rear motor is on demand:https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/toyota-rav4-hybrid-74572So perhaps it only comes on during full acceleration or when there is a slip with the front wheels? But I don���t get why the 4WD has only 3 additional KW compared to the 2WD when it has an additional 40kw motor in the rear.
So are there any compelling reasons to pay the premium for the hybrid version as opposed to normal petrol ICE?Also is it true that the RAV-4 doesn't have some of the newer tech things seen in the Hyundais etc?(I don't know specifically just what a recent Hyundai buyer told me)
Brissie writes...So perhaps it only comes on during full acceleration or when there is a slip with the front wheels?Yea that's right. Hard acceleration and front slip. Also the trail button is meant to activate it more often and more aggressively (among other changes).But I don���t get why the 4WD has only 3 additional KW compared to the 2WD when it has an additional 40kw motor in the rear.My guess is that the battery is already at its max discharge rate (battery longevity and heat generation). So for the most part it is diverting power that would have gone to the front and sending it to the rear.The quicker time may be due to the FWD version holding back some of the torque as it gets off the line (very common these days in high power cars) to maintain traction (it does have ~425Nm combined, hence the need for a mechanical LSD), whereas the AWD diverts some of that torque to the rears and hence doesn't need restricting off the line to keep the fronts under control. Just a guess but it is very logical.
VladTepes writes...So are there any compelling reasons to pay the premium for the hybrid version as opposed to normal petrol ICE?2.0L petrol engine vs 2.5L petrol engine plus an electric motor with the power of a 1.6L and torque of a 2.0L petrol engine. The difference in acceleration between the two is night and day.Not to mention the obvious fuel savings.
Plus resale would probably be better on the hybridb
Thanks.

My other car is a 3.8L V6 Holden Commodore and it does 8 seconds flat.Based on the test drive of a Rav4 Cruiser AWD Hybrid, compared to my Commodore, the RAV4 pulls harder from zero then eases off towards the 100kmph mark.Pretty impressive from a hybrid.I also tested the 2WD hybrid. The pull and acceleration is equally as impressive, but I felt quite a bit of torque steer even on dry road and had to fight the steering wheel a bit during hard acceleration. The difference of not having an extra 2 wheels made a bit of a difference there.

Dealer (who probably knows more) said that he thought it would be an August build but didn't know when it would reach him.
My order for the AWD Cruiser was placed on May 24.My pickup date is August 19. Confirmed
Steven_ZZZ writes...Hi, when did you pay the deposit? I paid in late June, the sales told me it might be built in AugustOriginally, I ordered 3 days after launch (GXL 2WD Hybrid) and was given an August build projection.  Nothing was confirmed for weeks, despite constant requests.I then received an email saying that the production problems (braking regen?) were mainly to do with the 2WD and my production date was pushed to November!  Obviously not happy, the dealer I was with 'just wondered' if the AWD H was an option (in my colour) as they had one of those on the way.   I raised the issue of the ridiculous waiting times for the ordered car and expected a 'great deal' on the incoming stock option.The dealer stepped up!  Not only did I get (IMO) about $2K more for my trade than I expected but an additional $2K off the RRP for the GXL AWD H.  I only asked for the mats and the boot mat (which is really top quality too BTW).Having driven only 500km so far, it's obviously not a completely 'informed' opinion, but I'm loving it.  Who knew radar cruise was a God send?  Lane keep assist takes some getting used to, but it's amazing as well.  I haven't owned a CVT before, even though this is my 23rd car.  I'm impressed! Although, I'm coming most recently from a KL Cherokee 3.2L and that was the worst car I've ever owned.  Never, ever again.  Anyway, no more gear hunting (which is a novelty for me :-D).I've a mix of freeway and city driving, probably 60/40 (although the freeway is a carpark sometimes) and I'm sitting on 5.9L/100.  I'm still on the original tank of fuel with an estimated 380km remaining.  So the target will be between 850 and 900k's for the tank. Again, coming from the Jeep, this is outstanding.No one has mentioned the headlights.  Damn!  It may as well be a night match at the G.  They. Are. So. Bright!  Automatic High Beam is accurate and brilliant.  The room in the back is outstanding for the size.  Again, smashes the Jeep out of the park.  Headroom, Leg room and the rear seats recline and lock in just enough too in case someone wants to have a nap.I can not relate to anyone's problem with noise inside the cabin.  Maybe all of my 22 other cars (6 of which were new) were just noisy buggers.  The Rav is probably one of the quietest cars I've had.  I'm looking forward the Android Auto / CarPlay update towards the end of the year, but this will be a bonus as I've got everything I need anyway with the system the way it is.I've not 'scored' a car before, but for comparative purposes if the Jeep was a generous 4, then the Rav is easily an 8 ��� 9.   Best change in vehicle I've made in recent years.
Ive been finding the road noise on coarse highways is a tad high. Maybe its just because the wind and engine noise is minimal compared to my previous dual cab. But you can definitely notice the tire roar.Couldn't compare it to other suvs back to back so im not sure how it is against the competition.

Brissie writes...You may not have jd the chance to drive in the wet as yet, but how noticeable is the torque steer or wheel spin?We test drove an AWD model in the wet and didn't get any slip at all (though didn't plant it too hard in the corners).Even the FWD should have minimal slip given the cars come with a mechanical LSD. This will stop the inside wheel lighting up.By comparison a family member used to own a ~2010 Rav4 with the FWD 2.4L manual power-train and that thing would brake traction off the lights in a straight line in the dry after the clutch had been completely engaged! I've never experienced anything like it. An absolute pig of a car.

The rear axle is exclusively powered by the addition of a single rear motor (40kW 121Nm).
GiveItaWhirl writes...I believe the Corolla and RAV share the same CVTOnly for the fleet/rental-focused 2.0L power-train.This system effectively uses a single "1st" gear from a conventional torque converter, after which it switches over to the CVT. This "hybrid gearbox" helps to alleviate the "hesitation" that is experienced off the line with CVT's.However this gearbox is absent from the other models.The Hybrid has no need for it as the electric motor(s) fill in the low end with large amounts of instantaneous torque, whilst the 2.5L non-hybrid version (many more models use this power-train in the North American market) has an 8-speed torque converter, as this power-train option is aimed more at off-roading and driver engagement.

It is a bit complex to explain how it works but here is a linkhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_DriveIt's basically a big set of planetary gears that ties in the engine, two electric motors and output shaft. No belts needed, the difference in speeds/direction of the engine and two motors creates the gear ratios. Historically their system is very reliable
jacknomiz writes...So is this annual service cost for the Hybrid?1-5 years ��� $210 plus $1445+ years ��� 500 bucks plus $144It is my understanding that the battery check starts at 5 years, then annual in order to achieve the 10 year guarantee.

Re the Nutmeg Interior.We had ordered nutmeg and the Dealer (who is very straight-up) strongly recommended against it, warning that it would harm residuals.

A friend of mine has gone to buy a RAV4 but has been told there is a 4 month wait, is this what others are experiencing or is it this dealer?
It is worth taking a look at the manual for the warranty and servicing schedule. That gives expected hours for each service through first 16 years (192 months) or 240,000km. The manuals for the RAV4 and most recent Toyotas are available on line at toyotamanuals.com.auYou can also use this site for a short term access (at moderate cost) to the Repair Manual for your vehicle, if there is a particular area of the vehicle that you want to investigate.It would not be reasonable to expect workshop labour prices to be fixed out for 16 years, so I expect growth in service costs over time
Four months for a Hybrid is about correct at present. I ordered one on 1 June 2019 and can expect it September or October. Non-hybrids are quicker
Maybe after today���s review in the Age, comparing the mainstream small SUVs, the RAV4 is going to have an even longer wait list!
Rang dealer today. Confirmed 4 month wait for my order, 5 at the latest. Seems like thats the average wait time at the moment.

Any idea when the 2020/21 RAV4 will be released? Will we get ventilated seats and two tone paint options as in US and Europe?
grahampeters writes...It would not be reasonable to expect workshop labour prices to be fixed out for 16 yearsNot sure where you got the notion of fixed price servicing for 16 years. It���s always been 3-5 years fixed (dependent on yr/kms) since Toyota introduced it. The contract of sale normally has these details.
bb4sr7 writes...Any idea when the 2020/21 RAV4 will be released? Will we get ventilated seats and two tone paint options as in US and Europe?Ah, ventilated seats on in the Edge now.  Might flow down to other models "one day" but there won't be any significant changes to range or options here for a year or so.
Apple to the core writes...Ah, ventilated seats on in the Edge now.  Might flow down to other models "one day" but there won't be any significant changes to range or options here for a year or so.It's a shame they didn't include them in the Hybrid Cruiser model this generation. Whilst heated seats are handy in winter, living in Perth I would much prefer ventilated seats. Why they don't at least offer it as an option is beyond belief!
alsheps writes...I'm ok with the speed warning and the Red light/speed camera warnings, it's just the school zone one, we tend to drive through a lot of them, but rarely at times when they apply, but the warnings happen regardless of what time/day it is.I think it's one warning out, all out, which is a bit annoying. I've noticed that when I leave work and turn away from the school zone, without ever entering it. The warning "caution entering school zone" chimes in even though, I've not entered and in fact am driving away from it.
Whats the best deal for GX Petrol FWD people have got ? In Adelaide here there seems to be no room for negotiation at all.I am considering CRV AWD also due its space especially for 2nd row.
Recommend you go to Cornes Toyota, usually can get 7% ��� 9% discount for RAV4
softkun123 writes...Whats the best deal for GX Petrol FWD people have got ?Should be able to easily get it down to $33,500 also don't forget to remove the sat nav optional feature for $1000 or so in savings. Just pick the standard white paint to save $600 over the "premium" ones.That was from maybe a month ago so you may even be able to get an even better deal now since nearly all the hype is for the hybrid model.

Anybody used motor scout to source RAV4, I wonder if they managed to get more than 10% discount.
Driver6M writes...There is always room to negotiate. Your aiming for 5 to 10 percent off drive away.Not necessarily. If dealers are moving vehicles at RRP easily, they dont really have any real enticement to discount vehicles.Once the hype does down, yeah probably. But given there is still a 3-4 month wait for the Hybrid Camry, it may not come around that fast.
jacknomiz writes...motor scoutI did use them and received 2 quotes back for a gxl fwd hybrid and the discount was a few hundred at most. From reading the forum here, I was hoping at least a couple of Ks off but not to be.

anyone have a comment on the OEM cargo mat, how much? worth it?
I'm not experienced but got a %6 discount from RRP off a gxl hybrid. The only hard part was listening to sales nonsense for 15 min. I had a realistic target and was prepared to walk if I couldn't get 5%. They are making their money even with a discount.
So I finally got on the RAV 4 train. Was looking for a Feb delivery but luckily someone cancelled and I got an atomic rush 2WD GXL Hybrid for $40,225. Delivery is first week of September. Fingers crossed they deliver on time

Also, the floor is carpet on one side and plastic on the other and can be flipped over.
Picked up an AWD GXL hybrid today (3 weeks after paying the deposit). We test drove a number of vehicles and the RAV4 was the only one we both agreed was worth buying. The Better Half did not like any of the Fords and the quality of the interior of the Holdens (even top spec models) seemed well below par. We didn���t mind the Nissans and Hyundais but the RAV4 ticked all the boxes.Silver Sky, tinted bonnet protector and weather shields, towing package, all weather floor mats and cargo mat.Have turned off most of the audio warnings at the request of the Better Half.
DockTony writes...!!!I'm hoping to get mine in a couple of weeks: was told end Aug but I've been allocated one in transit ��� presumably a cancellation.When did you order?

Is it ok to drive above 100kmh during the run in period?
AMG S writes...Is it ok to drive above 100kmh during the run in period?Of course it is. Simply accelerating from the traffic lights puts more strain on the engine than cruising at 110km/h.Just don't thrash the guts out of it, tow anything or use cruise control for the first couple thousand km's. Beyond that all you need to do is drive it normally.

AMG S writes...I used cruise control quite oftenYou should not use cruise control (especially for long periods) during the "break in" period as this will cause uneven wear due to the engine sitting at the exact same rpm. The engine needs to be placed under a wide variety of varying load and rpm (but nothing too extreme) to allow the pistons to "seat" into the cylinders.Not the end of the world, but not ideal and not what is recommended.

No worries.I should add that if you have the hybrid it might not actually matter that much, as that CVT does not mimic fixed gear ratios. But still, your foot will create a more variable engine load when cruising.

That's the beauty of opinions, everyone has one...But I'm curious as to what people might think is going to happen when fully self driving cars hit the market?  Guess they'll not  use cruise control and follow the advice as listed here in the manual?Breaking in your new Toyota.  To extend the life of the vehicle, observing the following precautions is recommended:���For the first 200 miles (300 km):Avoid sudden stops.���For the first 500 miles (800 km):Do not tow a trailer.���For the first 600 miles (1000 km):��� Do not drive at extremely highspeeds.��� Avoid sudden acceleration.��� Do not drive continuously in lowgears.��� Do not drive at a constant speedfor extended periods.  which may or may not be using CCOver a very long driving history with numerous new cars, I've not once had a problem associated with 'Not being run in properly'.  But each to their own..

That is inline with every other new car manual I've seen in recent years.Feathers writes...Over a very long driving history with numerous new cars, I've not once had a problem associated with 'Not being run in properly'.  But each to their own..Its a contributing factor in addition to how hard the car is driven, how regularly it is serviced and any unlucky manufacturing defects. Also bear in mind deviations in these things may not manifest into major engine issues (e.g. failed big-end bearing) until long after you've sold the new car to someone else.These issues also tend to occur earlier in highly strung performance engines, particularly those with forced-induction. I doubt anyone's going to have issues with their Rav4 unless they're either extremely unlucky or particularly brutal.

Any real or imagined problem with any new car will well and truly have presented itself within (in Toyota's case) the first 5 years and unlimited kilometers of manufacturers warranty.We're incredibly lucky in Australia, our warranties across everything we buy are stronger than many believe.  In fact, a proven well maintained vehicle (or any product) can be argued that warranty may still apply even after the official warranty has expired.The idea to 'baby' a car (any car) for the first 1000k's is a continued after sales technique that contributes to 'buy in' or 'personal investment' to prevent buyers remorse and any potentially related negative connotations that may hurt the brand in the future.
Hi Looking at getting the Rav 4, going for a test drive of the Cruiser AWD hybrid on Saturday, been offered ~46k although I wanted to ask if anyone has the Toyota dashcam. I am keen to get one although $500 seems pretty steep. I like that it is integrated so no cords hanging around so am willing to pay it but just wanted to see if anyone has any details on it or have it themselves.
Remember the Toyota cam is forward recording only.I changed mine to the Gnet camera. Toyota wanted $1195.00. (Can buy the camera for $695.00)Got it for $795.00 installed .My Cruiser should be here in the middle of August.
Feathers writes...The idea to 'baby' a car (any car) for the first 1000k's is a continued after sales technique that contributes to 'buy in' or 'personal investment' to prevent buyers remorse and any potentially related negative connotations that may hurt the brand in the future.To the contrary; if you thrash the car and something goes wrong you may fight less vigorously for warranty, believing you may be in part to blame. On the other hand if you follow all instruction and something bad still occurs, then you know solely where the blame lies. Same goes for buying new vs. used, and for getting it properly serviced. I've had repairs covered well beyond warranty thanks to this. The ACCC will only look after you if the vehicle has been maintained according to manufacturer policy, and if there is no evidence that you thrashed it.It also just makes perfect mechanical sense that you want the moving mechanical parts to properly seat against on another before you abuse them.
Marlin writes...Got it for $795.00 installed .Thanks Marlin will look into that one and congrats on getting the cruiser! With the Gnet, are you getting that installed when the toyota arrives or is it one that you currently own?
It gets installed when the car gets here by the Dealer.

muzzamo writes...If eco works like it does on the Camry, if you want to get off the line quick or overtake you don���t need to turn it off.Well hadnt been giving it much throttle for the first 1k so it was easier just to press the sport button
mpk- writes...You���re kidding right??? Dealers must love youLol. Dealers must love YOU.Skimming is about 2/3 the cost of new rotors + install. Rotors aren't expensive; labour is. We're talking about ~$100 difference for a pair to avoid the below.When skimmed you take already worn rotors and take additional material taken off. They now have a limited life remaining. Also they often stuff up the skimming process, meaning the disks will wear unevenly as will your pads, resulting in both having a greatly reduced lifespan.Then when your thin and possibly unevenly worn rotors need replacing, your new brake pads will now need to be skimmed down as well (more labour costs), and you open yourself up to the same above issues but this time for your pads (that will soon need to be replaced anyway, meanwhile they wear unevenly on your new rotors).In the long-term, it's cheaper and less drama to just do them at the same time.I've heard this straight from a service managers mouth when talking about his daughters car when he dropped me back home, having had the rotors skimmed only to need them replaced shortly after at a different manufacturers dealership (the other dealership recommend skimming ��� when he found out he was furious), and I had the exact same thing happen personally as his own dealership (they had to replace the skimmed rotors with new ones free of labour costs as they were wearing unevenly on the new pads ��� they stuffed up).

Does anybody know if the side mirrors auto fold when you lock the doors ?

So here's some relevant and current data for readers.I signed yesterday (24/7/19) at my local (Sydney based) Toyota dealer for a new RAV4. Cruiser Hybrid 2WD + metallic paint (saturn blue) + Nutmeg interior + floor mats+ cargo mat (mats = $209).Specced on the Toyota website drive away this is $46,767.Went to a bunch of brokers + financiers who claimed they could beat down the price. Best offer from them after a fortnight of drip-fed "we're still waiting for a few to come back" was $44,852 (�� $1915 or 4.1% off RRP, coupled to 6.7% finance as a novated lease). The offered explanation was "new model, contained stock, zero motivation to discount from dealers".Compare this to Mazda who jumped at the chance to drop 10% off the RRP for a Touring CX-5, and who had the right colour in stock, drive away within a week, when I test drove one a week earlier.A hard decision. But frankly, the Mazda didn't excite me as much as I thought it would, despite the steeper discount and availability.Eventually I went back to my local Toyota dealer who had effectively sold me on the RAV and asked for $44,650 (4.5% off the retail), and 4.98% finance (the best I had seen elsewhere) as a novated lease, improving on the 5.2% finance they had originally offered. They said yes. The establishment costs of Toyota finance and the annual management fee were as good as most of the other quotes I received. I felt a hunch there was yet more room to move but I based my offer on the best brokered price I got and deducted another $200. My reasoning was that if a glut model (eg CX-5) has a margin of 10% and most brokered quotes on the RAV hovered around 5% off RRP, then that's around their comfort level. I still wonder if I should have put an offer of $44K neat.Having inked the deal, I am informed the *build* date will be 15-Oct, plus the ship time on top of that. Adding a month for freight, that's 3 and a half months for a factory order.Hope this helps.
tigger08 writes...Does anybody know if the side mirrors auto fold when you lock the doors ?Marlin writes...No they don���t.The switch for the mirrors has no automatic setting.Strangely the option is available in Techstream, set to sync with the door locking/unlocking by default. Other options are via ignition or off. Adjusting the setting has no effect and they will only fold when pressing the button.

softkun123 writes...Do we really require full size spare wheel for rav4? It costs 300$ from dealer.Really the 'full size' vs 'space saver' spare question is only one that you can answer as your requirements may well be different from others.If you don't drive a lot of km's, and are rarely any distance from a tyre shop then maybe you don't need a full size spare.Conversely if you drive a lot of km's, are often long distances from a tyre shop and also you use the car for work so you rely on it, then yes a full size spare would probably be high on your priority list.And no, by the time you source a rim and a tyre aftermarket it would more than likely cost more.GiveItaWhirl writes...and would a full size 18" spare fit in the space?Yes the full size 18" spare fits, you just lose the ability to drop the cargo floor to the lower level due to the fatter rim and rubber.

Hi guys, went and test drove both the petrol Cruiser and the Hybrid and have decided on the 2WD Hybrid Cruiser. Haven���t signed anything yet but Dealer has agreed $43490 with mats, tint and cargo mat.I feel its a good deal but what do you guys think? Also told me that they currently are saying a 6month wait but have 1600 units coming in August to help clear the backlog so I was told it was possible a build date in September means delivery in October.Thanks!
ashnathan writes...Dealer has agreed $43490 with mats, tint and cargo mat.Seems hard to negotiate larger discounts due to the limited supply. That pretty much the same discount i got for the AWD cruiser variant and I was happy.

softkun123 writes...Do we really require full size spare wheel for rav4? It costs 300$ from dealer.If the dealer supplied full size spare is identical to the wheels and tyres on the vehicle then it can be incorporated into your tyre rotation program allowing you to get value out of your expenditure.

If not rotated, a new spare will still have a limited life, based on age. Ours is over 5 years now and may need to be replaced in a year.

My AWD Cruise is down to last �� petrol. Just wondering if anyone here will pump 95 fuel over the 91?Any performance benefit over the 95?
3RiC writes...Any performance benefit over the 95?https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unleaded-petrol-119462"3-5% increase" but, you're paying a lot more for fuel. However, 95 and 98RON have less sulphur etc (50ppm vs 150ppm) so you're polluting less.
My dealer recommended 4 tanks of 91 and one tank of 95.

Hey everyone,I just bought a 2wd Cruiser hybrid this weekend and am wondering how accurate the dealer delivery dates have been for everyone else?

Given mine is due to come 3 days after my bub is due. What date were you given needanewname?
mpk- writes...Your point?Jeeps with keyless start have remote start.
Just got an email saying mine is due to be built in October, here in aus by November and ready for pickup Early December. We've also got a little bubba in our family due during December so I want to get the car stuff over and done with before that so I can help out with bubs.When did you purchase yours?
Congrats! I have not got an email as yet but the contract said it would be delivered 11th of December Bub due on the 8th. Not sure if that is their estimate date or an actual date for delivery. We purchased ours on Saturday. Ideally, we would get the car at least a week before so we can organise car seat. That said not end of the world if we don't as we still have our current CX 3One other question as I just had a follow-up call from the dealership. I am getting a cam Blackvue, that is agreed but they tried to sell us permaguard. We already have a tint included in our price so this is for the paint protection and the leather protection. Is it something worth considering or just a bit of extra margin for the dealership with no added benefit for the car? Did anyone get it?
I dunno but the dealer I went through seemed pretty honest he said the cam was overpriced and better to just get one installed somewhere else for cheaper when I asked about it =P
Feathers writes...Jeeps with keyless start have remote startRight, fair enough.

Is there a need for me to go for AWD, instead of 2WD cause I don't wanna spend extra. looking to buy RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid._I maybe go off-road once or twice a year._Often carry heavy stuff IN the car (2-3 times a week).Thanks for the advice.
I paid deposit for the rav4 and dealer is fine with 1st August pickup. What's the delivery procedure. Do we have to Sign contract before delivery date? I am paying by cash so can i transfer money online on the deliver date.... But they would receive payment perhaps 2 business days later.

Just let them know your concerns and they will help you sort it out.They are very accommodating in taking your money and removing the car from their lot.
My impression is that the hybrid AWD isn't a real mud plugger. I went for it (delivery due in the next week) on the promise of much better stability in marginal conditions ��� driving frosty twisty roads etc. Yes, it's more more money but you'll get a portion of it back when you sell, also the effect on fuel consumption is minimal.
Picking my AWD Cruiser hybrid tomorrow after 2 months of waiting. Had a loan car for that time and the dealer wanted the car back on Friday. The swap over was a GX RAV4 for the last few days.
Ordering a Hybrid Cruiser AWD, atomic rush paint.Carpet mats, tinted bonnet protector, headlamp protectors, full tank, tinting with UV, 12 months on roads47500 in SA. I think its an OK deal.Now for the long wait.

Driver6M writes...Apparently privacy glass doesn't have UV protection on side windowsApparently it does.
Side windows have no UV protection because they are not laminated so UV goes straight through. The rear side window privacy glass only has a dye added so no UV protection. However the rear and front wind screens have laminated glass for safety hence the lamination blocks out UV. The dye on the rear wind screen does nothing except provide privacy.

So forgive if this question has been asked before: If I've just dropped a deposit on a RAV with a ~3 month wait, is there or isn't there an online portal that lets us track our orders?My dealer gives a surprisingly vague response: "Yeah. I think there is. I'll need to look that up."One would think this is their bread-and-butter.Just like when I was approaching the purchase a month back and asked about the RAV sales stop and he said he knew nothing about it. Yeah, right.

You have to specifically ask for your username and password as well  ��� if I hadn't already known about the feature and asked for the login details, I wouldn't have got them.Asked for them and got a forwarded email from someone else in the supply chain with the credentials.From what I can see it's primarily designed for dealers to use I'm guessing, and they too seem to need to ask someone else for the password just to view... I could be wrong though.
I was referring to the front windows, not the rear privacy glass.

They're nothing secret and both numbers are updated on the contract once the build is allocated by TMC. The key here is the stock controller in the dealership needs to flag the vehicle in SAP so a customer can use the tracking service.

Toyota privacy glass does jack when it comes to sun protection its only for privacy and is just dyed glass.The cost to tint even with clear tint through the dealer is based on 5 windows so there is no reason not to tint the rear privacy glass with fully transparent film.

Looking at getting the cruiser hybrid AWD. Every winter we go to the snow, thredbo etc. would this vehicle be ok getting us there. Don���t want to carry or use chains.
Gurya writes...Looking at getting the cruiser hybrid AWD. Every winter we go to the snow, thredbo etc. would this vehicle be ok getting us there. Don���t want to carry or use chains.Best look at the requirements of the location you are skiing at regarding chains. Most likely you will find, regardless of the vehicle you will/may be required to carry chains. Whether or not you will need to fit them will depend on the conditions on the day, with genuine 4WD's being the last vehicles required to fit chains.Having standard road tyres all year round in Australia, and not winter tyres like in Europe and the States/Canada is also a major limiting factor in the ability to maintain grip in the snow.
Graham121 writes...Having standard road tyres all year round in Australia, and not winter tyres like in Europe and the States/Canada is also a major limiting factor in the ability to maintain grip in the snow.Yep.If you're going every year to the snow, then get some chains. It's about safety and not endangering yourself, others or emergency workers who have to dig you out.I lived in the USA for quite a while and we were going to the snow every week (hey, 50mins drive ��� wouldn't you?). I actually had winter tires for those months and an AWD SUV and even so you had to be careful when there was ice (it's the time when it's sunny and around 0C where you get a bit of melt, then it hardens to be black ice that you have to be really careful). I watched a lot of people who didn't spin (almost hitting me), hit the snow banks, or just lose control. Don't be these people.
Thanks for your replies. I���ll get this car and just carry chains for emergencies.

Was considering an AWD hybrid, but the wait times are too long for all hybrid variants. Dealers have received internal communication indicating wait times could blow out up to 12 months. Will be used for occassional moderate towing, so will be going an Edge instead.

Drat, I have just had The Call was well.Was early October, now early December.
Petrol one really isn't that bad if you guys don't want to wait =P Have been driving it for awhile now seems to be sitting at about 7.5-8L per 100km so its not terrible if you drive it gently on eco.Problem with being delayed till December is you get a 2019 plated car one month till 2020 so its instantly a year older on paper. If they bump you that far maybe ask for a 2020 manufacture date and wait a little longer.
Just spoke to my sales guy, I was told mine was due for production this month, now it is postponed until mid-October, so delivery might be mid to late November.Earlier yesterday i spoke to Toyota Australia, and i was told production was halted because of the break issue since 11th July, and it won't start until they fix this issue, hence this delay i guess. The dealer also refused to give out a loan car.Now I am seriously considering to get Forester instead, as I need the car by the end of September.

Collected my Cruiser hybrid AWD today ��� dealer confirmed they are now quoting six months for new orders. Drove it 75km on 60 and lower limit roads. First impressions: it drives beautifully (as expected); dash showed fuel consumption of 4.7 (60 is probably the sweet spot for economy) ��� will do a tank brim-to-brim at some point; doors shut with a satisfying clunk. Two small minuses: it would nice if mirror fold was on permanent live like my  X-Trail ��� you kill the power and then remember that you wanted to fold the mirror, too late; and the poseur in me would like an AWD badge on the back. The turning circle felt usefully tighter than my X-Trail but according to figures not much in it: 11.0 v. 11.3m.
Feathers writes...whrl.pl/RfnOtx ��� looks like you've been 'bumped'.......  Not uncommon...Seems that 'bumping' is probably a major reason some dealers don't like providing tracking info. I would suggest that anyone ordering a Toyota make use of the tracking system./thread/3q6qm219?p=56
I am concerned that I am in that camp, I have been chasing for the online tracking system access with no love for the past week and a half with the sales staff saying they have no idea what it is.
My order was placed 1 June and I expected a four month delay, which is no concern for me. Dealer advised a week or two ago that production had been pushed back a month so I am expecting November, maybe. That is not an issue for me at present
"Restating something I wrote a while back about finding the status of your Order. See esepcially my suggestion for escalating the issue if the sales person (or dealer)  seems shifty about providing details.Email the salesman to request the Identification which will look something like this:Customer Name:	Mr. Fred BloggsCustomer Order Number:	9876543Access Code:	1234567The Status will show as On Order/Scheduled for Production or in Production/In Transit to Australia/In Storage Yard/In Transit/Being Prepared for Pick up.The Planned Production Month may not be available for some time so check back every couple of weeks. Do not bother hanging on it every day.There is a block of detail of your order showing Vehicle Description / Colour/Trim/Factory Options (effectively grade of vehicle) and then fields for VIN/Engine Number/Compliance Plate date/Build dateThere is also a block of information for the dealers details and also a block for Toyota HelpIt sure beats ringing the dealer to find out what is going on.It is reasonable to expect that it will take a few days to a week for the order to be uploaded,a s there are cooling off periods on car sales contracts in various states (typically about 3 days) and paperwork does take some time to wend its way through any systemThere is not a logical reason why the dealer/sales representative will not give you this detail. If you get no joy, ring the Dealer's receptionist and ask for the Dealer Principal's email address (you can usually find his details by a brief internet search under the dealership name and ""Dealer Principal"") . State question to the Sale Representative (or if no luck there, the Dealer Principal) clearly with a phrase like""I refer to our contract number 1234567 dated 15 June 2019. Could you please confirm the Customer Order Number and Access Code in order that I can track the progress of the order on the Toyota Track My Order site"".If you don't get a response in a day or two, escalate to the Dealer Principal and if no joy there, escalate to Toyota Helpline on 1800 252 097Do remember that sales staff often have odd working weeks, so they may be having days off when you call. Do cut them some slack as they have family lives too!"

Hi have been on to my dealer about my car. Said there was nothing yet but has said that he has a white one available that I can get if I want it. Not too sure as I was getting a blue one. What should I do?
the_rats_girl writes...What should I do?If it's exactly the same other than the color, I'd be jumping all over it.  The car is definitely worth having sooner rather than later (IMO).  A white one (I think) should be that little bit cheaper too, maybe use that for some accessories or pocket the difference.Personally, I've halved my fuel bill for the month and it's wonderful to drive.  Waiting for a particular color might be preferable but in all honesty, a white one will hold it's value just that little bit better in the future being considered a 'neutral' colour.If you don't have tracking available or a confirmed production date, then the wait times can still blow out.  Some are quoting 6 months now from buying to expected delivery date.  I was in the same boat as you when my dealer offered me a slightly different variant that he had in stock.  My only difference was I ordered a 2WDH GXL and they had an AWDH GXL.I was even able to negotiate on the price, which was really difficult / hardly anything with the one on order.
Thanks for that. Yes he said there was no tracking for the rag only the ch. my daughter had her heart set on blue as she thinks white is boring and gets dirty too easily but yes I���m going to look at it today they also had a red 2wd available. Not sure if I want a 2wz but am looking forward to saving on petrol

My last car was built 1998, so it's a 20+ year jump in vehicles models for me- I live/breathe tech, so this car and the features is right up my alley ��� particularly driver assist- The Eco score and monitoring is helpful ��� it gives you a rating at the end of your drive, so my partner and I have a competition of sorts going on- Keyless entry/start is amazing ��� although it is initially quite weird not knowing if the car is running once started (no noise/vibration that I'm used to)-Looks are absolutely smashin' compared to the previous model; I originally wanted a Rav4 after seeing how the older models look like mini Landcruisers, but I'm happy for the sporty trade-off-Regardless of how many others got the same color ��� Crystal Pearl looks wonderful compared to plain white. Yes, I know any repairs will be costly ��� but given this is my first new car (and how much I paid for it), I might as well get *exactly* what I wanted- Car came at least a month before the projected date ��� I ordered late May- Separate heating/cooling temps for driver and passenger aircon ��� no more battling there- Boot: flipping the boot cover over from the fabric side to the plastic(?) side ��� saved needing to buy a boot mat (I guess?)CONS:- The wireless charging dash area has what looks like grippy material in it, but as I live in the country I'm finding my phone is slipping around a lot and therefore coming off charge a lot; I'm going to be trying a different type of phone case, and if that fails I might just put a tiny blob of silicone in there for grip- No dash light in the glovebox. I'm yet to finish reading the instruction manual but that seems pretty pov for a mid-tier build- I sincerely hope they can allow a toggle for that annoying school reminder to only occur during the required hours- Driving out of my house in the country, it's a few minutes until you hit your first speedsign; this does seem to frustrate my car a little, who will remind you to stick to local laws/regulations the moment you go over 60km/h (country limit is a typical 100km/h)-I was planning on using that Rav4 $500 deal... Was a little annoyed as the dealer had my car on the last day of the deal (July 31st), however I didn't receive my car until 2 days later ��� meaning I missed the deadline, in no less part due to the multitude of build delays. I have written to Toyota customer service to see if it can be backdated but I'm not too optimistic on that-Would definitely like to see the mirrors auto-fold when car is turned offI'll come back and give some more hints as I find more stuff...Now I'm looking forward to the Android retrofit ��� however I was wondering if it were possible to have both the Android and Apple system fit and just switch between the 2 as needed?

BeerMonkeyGreen writes...One question for those that have a cruiser, I found the beeping from the boot opening annoying. Not a deal-breaker but was annoying. Is it possible to switch that off?No, you can't turn it off (handbook p.382, note 2 at bottom), but you can change the volume from the default 3 to 1 or 2. I guess this is regarded as a safety thing.
Having the sound on setting 1 is a lot quieter.
DockTony writes...No, you can't turn it offCan you disconnect the device making the sound ��� seems like the obvious answer.
Hint: From reading the handbook, if you're the only driver and the spare key will live in a drawer, you can put it into battery saver mode by holding the lock button down and pressing open twice (p.115). When I was prepping my X-Trail for trade-in I found that the spare key had gone flat (I'd had the main key battery replaced a while back).

Hi all,We got our auto 2WD petrol version cruiser 2 days back. Overall happy with the purchase as we cannot wait for 6 months to get hybrid.One thing I am noticing from past 2 days is that i need to push accelerator hard for pickup and when we give race the car is lil noisy . Not sure because of the new car as earlier we  bought old mazda and when we just slightly put our foot on accelerator it pick up very well bt not is the same case with Rav4.Hoping because of the new engine may be it will take time to settle.
ndb21 writes...I am noticing from past 2 days is that i need to push accelerator hard for pickup and when we give race the carI might be wrong but someone with the owners manual may clarify.But I think it is advised as part of the engine running in to avoid hard acceleration for the first so many km's.
The old gen 2.0 RAV4 was gutless as anything. But the new model has a lot more power and torque, so it could just be running in still
Sorry to mention our is automatic one not manual..
Hi all,I purchased the car 15th July and was given a date of early August for delivery. I have now been told by the dealer that is is going to be end of November. I have a newborn due late September and absolutely need the car by then.Any ideas what can be done? This is our first time purchasing a new car and it's all very foreign to us
Any ideas what can be done?Sounds like me, I ordered 2/7 and have been told early December.  But the word on the showroom floor is that this could be extended even further out.I have not yet cancelled but am looking at other options:  Lexus is my favourite so far, but with the 'luxury' comes higher cost sadly.

I have a trade-in involved, so can't really tell you our price as we concentrated on changeover. Plus I used to work for the dealer I'm buying from, so kinda rates mates.Try and aim for around $48-$49K before any options or accessories. TMCA still aren't offering dealers any incentives on the 50 series RAV4 yet, as they've only been on the market for a few months, so you'll have to negotiate hard.There's only one or two in the khaki colour in the country presently, less one now. You may have to order one.

Yesterday I saw a 2019 Rav4 in Perth (south) and followed for few mins. It doesn't look as impressive as it does in media / adverts. I now lost my interest and incline towards Mazda.

Kind of like the Forester, you dont buy one purely for its looks, you buy it for other reasons.Although I reckon the Edge looks fantastic, just wish it kept its outdoorsy sounding Adventure name in Australia.

How do you turn off speed warnings?
My car has arrived in Perth after ordering on the 24/5 (Cruiser Hybrid AWD). I received a call from the dealer saying there was going to be a delay for delivery to them but they had intervened in time. Supposedly they're out of stock on the hybrid badge and were going to hold delivery until parts arrived from the factory. I'll be getting the car without a badge to begin with and have it fitted after. I find it funny they'd not fit it during manufacturing.
Tell them to add AWD badges while they are at it :-)Sometimes things like badges are added at the ports at facilities the car makers contract services to

Alternatively look for the destination port and then find all inbound vehicle carriers that are inbound from Nagoya and that's possibly your ship.
Thanks mate.

To edit speed warnings go through setup/navigation.  There are lots of options you can set.

anyone can share a good price on a 2019 new generation 2wd GXL?I have been quoted $37.5K.GX best price on this forum is 33K.
I would consider the GX Hybrid for just $2000 more than the base GX it has features that sit in between the GX and GXL.

jnu123 writes...a good idea, just $2000 more? at 35K for a GX Hybrid?I can see smart key system is added to Hybrid.Yeah that's what the dealer said when I was negotiating my GX Petrol a few months ago was about $2000 to upgrade from petrol to the hybrid. Assume it would still be the same now.

taqman writes...Is the Nutmeg leather interior difficult to keep clean?No, it isn���t. The leather is more hardy than supple. The car is approaching 5,000km and I wear blue jeans a lot; there are very faint markings on the squab but a quick wipe-down solves them.The nutmeg really brightens up the cabin and makes the interior feel a bit more premium.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVv1ef3gQE&t=169sNice review here with the Graphite/Nutmeg colour combination.That���s me, and the specific car we are talking about here.

I had it turned off from day 1, it still clicks for the first 30 mins of my driving each day.When you go to work at 5:30 am in the morning plus a quiet cabin. The clicking sound is very audible.

I need some advice. Have signed a contract on a Cruiser Hybrid 2WD but still have the option to change to AWD, can anyone give me any reasons to consider the AWD as we have come into a few extra thousand dollars so we can definitely go the AWD, pros/cons would be great, thanks.
AWD gives a higher tow rating, which helps future proof the car a little
ashnathan writes...can anyone give me any reasons to consider the AWD1) Resale Value.  AWD will definitely hold it's value better than a 2WD version.2) Towing capacity goes from 480kg for the 2WD to 1500kg for the AWD.I'm sure there's more.....
More like try to find reasons not to get AWD, other than a small up front cost...
ashnathan writes...pros/cons would be great, thanksa con is it's just another thing that can wrong, especially with age.So, whilst I'm not disagreeing with the assertion AWD resale is better, it may work the other wayI'd approach it more on a needs basis, driving locales and conditions, towing etc

Considering the GXL 2WD Hybrid.Has anyone compared the cabin feel, fit and finish to competitors? How does it stack up?
For me, Better and more modern than the CX-5 ( more minimalist) however not on the same plateau as the European cars ��� however a look at the reliability of the VW, Audi���s and Volvo���s will steer you well clear of them.
Most euros have good reliability so I wouldnt let that put me off, probably better than Mazda in many casesYou can see the rankings herehttps://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/mass-market-brands-outperform-luxury-marques-reliability-power-saysToyota does very well
Picked up my Cruiser Hybrid AWD in Graphite last night. It drives great (though getting used to the LTA which seems to be quite aggressive) and looks amazing.So far noticed the following things that I'm not entirely happy with;- Lack of Automatic Locking Retraction (ALR) for the rear seat belts meaning child seat fitting is more difficult. I have a 6mth ��� 8yr old seat (top of the range and brand new) that doesn't have ISOFIX so this means I was relying on the ALR for safer mounting.- Have to work out how to stop the "follow road regulations" warning when near speed limit. This was activating at 58km/hr when speed limit was 60km/hr (and signs were detected). - Cruise control seems to want to stick at 1km/hr below the set speed. Not a big deal but I set the speed limit for a reason ��� my Outback with dynamic cruise didn't do the same.Will go for a few drives over the weekend and report back if I find anything else but very happy with the purchase!Fuel economy in first 90km has been about 6.1L / 100km with mostly highway speeds with a little bit of peak hour crawl.
jasonbau writes...though getting used to the LTA which seems to be quite aggressiveGo into your settings and turn down the sensitivity for it.Lack of Automatic Locking Retraction (ALR) for the rear seat beltsToyota stopped fitting ALRs a few years ago, nothing like a bit of good ol' cost-cutting.
ISOFIX solves it anyway.

AWD will definitely hold it's value better than a 2WD version.2) Towing capacity goes from 480kg for the 2WD to 1500kg for the AWD.I'm sure there's more.....is there any reason Rav 4 2WD tow capacity only rated at 480KG while cx-5 2L 2wd is rated 750KG unbraked / 1800KG braked?
jasonbau writes...Cruise control seems to want to stick at 1km/hr below the set speed.Yep, I noticed this too. But just set it 1 above where I want it.   GPS speed matching has the Rav4 (in my vehicle) as 2km/h over anyway. So when the car is showing 102 it's really 100.  So I set the cruise at 103 for example.
jnu123 writes...is there any reason Rav 4 2WD tow capacity only rated at 480KG while cx-5 2L 2wd is rated 750KG unbraked / 1800KG braked?Looking at the Specs, it seems that the lower towing capacity is on the 2WD hybrid only. The petrol only 2WD has towing of 750 (unbraked) 800 (braked).

We ordered a GX Hybrid AWD 2 weeks ago. The dealer said when the order was first placed it said October but then a couple of days later the build date updated to 15 January. Any ideas why and is anyone else waiting 6 months?I've just applied for the order and access code to track the order online.
First brim to brim fill on my RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid AWD: 645km of mixed driving, 36.7l = 5.7l/100km, exactly what the dash said. Also found out today that whilst the driver seat is electric with two memories, passenger seat is manual.
Picked up our Edge on Wednesday. Damn nice to drive, very happy with it.Done a lot of customise options in Techstream including killing off the beeping when the power back door is operating, remote power window/roof open/close, 5 flashes instead of 3 for the auto indicators and a few other bits and pieces.According to the manual, there is a customise option to delay (and effectively stop) the headlights turning on when driving under bridges/overpasses, but it's not in Techstream. Need to have a look through the workshop manual to find the procedure, usually is done following a sequence with the headlight switch and ignition.
Picked up the Edge just over a week ago.  Where the wireless charger is, there is supposed to be ambient lighting (well,  at least according to the online brochure and spec data that I downloaded from Toyota).  Had a feel of where there should be a light, there is just a hole.  Took a photo and can actually see the wiring through it.Called the sales guy on Tuesday and he told me he checked the Edges they have in and all have holes.  Told him what the brochure/spec data has, that both the Cruiser & Edge have ambient lighting.  He said he'll find out but have not heard back from him (ok, he did tell me he had couple of days off).So, to those who have purchased the Edge, can you confirm if there is indeed ambient lighting where the wireless charger is.
Picked up the GXL Hybrid 2WD in Red with black interior yesterday.So far, pretty positive impressions. Car drives pretty smoothly and has good economy despite being driven in heavy traffic. I have it in eco mode but response is pretty good if you demand it. Lots of safety features and the speed / light radar warning is always good :D School zone warning becomes annoying if you keep driving through the same roads.Sound system was impressive given Toyota's past record of having tinny speakers with no punch. All songs sound full and crisp with a real surround atmosphere.Infotainment system is not great and the GPS system is only a backup in case phone battery dies. Can't wait for Android Auto / Car Play to drop in these bad boys. The wireless charging will be useful in future.
Hi PinzVidz, sorry if I am asking a silly question but, what is Techstream? I see this mentioned a lot here. Is it a platform, an app, a program by which you can plug something in and customise? How do I access it? How do I get it to work? Appreciate your help.
Techstream is the software Toyota/Lexus utilise on a Windows laptop/PC for diagnosis/testing/config and also for customisation. Connects using a USB to OBDII cable, specific for Toyota.

Sounds minor but im sure Toyota will retrofit it at Service?As an aside, a client I did work for had something like this when the current updated 200 Series came out, he purchased a GXL and the brochure stipulated it came with a certain feature that when inquired about was told it does not and only comes on the VX/Sahara, he threatened to expose this for class action against Toyota for false advertising so they picked up his GXL and gave him a VX, that is definitely a minority situation, but my point is that Toyota have done this before which for a huge company like Toyota, is quite poor.

Wondering if I should just go for that rather than wait out for the Cruiser hybridI guess it depends on the dealer and what you are after (colour, options, etc).  The one I bought from had a few in stock.  I signed up on Saturday and picked the car up the following Friday.
From Today's Melbourne Age:"Been told you'll need to wait 6 months for your new RAV4? It's one of the most in-demand SUVs on the road, so Paul Maric wanted to find out whether it's worth the wait. ....If we were to pick holes in the RAV4 and point out negatives, they'd really only come down to a lack of head-up display (available in a few of its competitors) and a very poor 360-degree camera ��� it lacks clarity to make it a worthwhile addition to the car.Outside of this, the RAV4 really nails the brief on size, on-road dynamics, cabin noise and features. It's rewarding to drive, efficient, and it's not hard to see why there is a line around the corner of people wanting to get themselves into one....So, is a waiting list justified for the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid? Yes, absolutely. It's the reason we crowned it the best medium-sized SUV on sale at the moment, and outside of a few minor gripes, it's an incredibly good car that provides outstanding value for money."https://www.drive.com.au/new-car-review/2019-toyota-rav4-cruiser-hybrid-awd-review-122202.html (might be paywalled)
Techstream is the software Toyota/Lexus utilise on a Windows laptop/PC for diagnosis/testing/config and also for customisation. Connects using a USB to OBDII cable, specific for Toyota.Hi PinzVidz, can I use Techstream on any new Toyota? Any USB to OBDII cable or needs to be special cable sourced from Toyota? Thanks.
jacknomiz writes...can I use Techstream on any new Toyota? Any USB to OBDII cable or needs to be special cable sourced from Toyota?Yes, from early 2000s onwards. Cable needs to be suited for Techstream ��� the official Toyota one is made by Mongoose and is very expensive. There's plenty of knock-off ones on eBay and the likes for a smidgen of the price of the official unit.
I'm considering the GX or GXL hybrid version of this. I see the heated font seats are available on the Cruiser up though. But I have heated front seat in my current vehicle and do love using that on cold Melbourne winter mornings... A nice warm bum :)But I'm not that interested in the other extras the Cruiser has...Does anyone know if it is possible to customise the GX or GXL to have heated front seats? I'm guessing it'll just be simpler and probably more cost effective to just get the Cruiser... But I do want to ask if anyone has done this and if so, how much it cost?I plan to go into the local vendor this weekend, but curious to know in advance if possible. If nobody knows, I'll ask there.

You might have to wait until someone writes one off :(. One thing I have noted with my Cruiser Hybrid is how fast it warms up: my X-Trail diesel took around 2km to move the temp gauge; on my RAV by the time I've gone down six floors of car park the heater is blowing warm. Presumably this is because the water pump is electric so from cold there's no coolant circulation, unlike with belt-driven water pumps which are always working,

we get four capped service at the price of $210 for petrol and hybrid model?Even they change brake fluid or in cabin filter, cost is still $210, right?
jnu123 writes...can we cancel contract if not delivered within 4 months, i mean 6 months is long way to go, and in six months time, price may be easier to negotiate.It might be, but since the launch date the Aussie dollar has gone down about 10% against the Yen, so at some point there may be a price increase to compensate. If you've not already signed up, you can ask for whatever terms you like; it's then up to the dealer to agree or not.
I work at a dealership in Port Macquarie. Toyota are telling us minimum 6 month wait due to the popularity worldwide. As Australia is such a small player in the worldwide market, we get smaller number of vehicles out of Toyota factory. We have 3 unsold Hybrid ravs due to arrive in August/September- Silver and Saturn Blue 2WD GXL models and a White 2wd  GXL model coming into stock. We will have no trouble selling so no discounts on these models but if you are prepared to wait i will look at options for me. If i can answer any questions please let me know, Jesse Schmidt.
5 services, every 12 months or 15,000kms for the first 5 years or 75,000kms.. all parts and labour inclusive :)
Can someone initiate an excel to present prices?What's the best price for GX 2.0 in Perth?
OK thanks all for the replies on the heated seat question. I'll check with the dealer when I go there. It does sound very doubtful, but won't know for sure unless I ask them.
dougals writes...... A nice warm bum :)Lol those things make me think I have had an accident and peed or pooped myself. Live in Canberra and have never needed heated seats and its way colder here than Melb =P Might make sense with non fabric seats though.
Vyviel writes...Live in Canberra and have never needed heated seats and its way colder here than Melb =Maybe my bum feels the cold more than yours :)Anyhow, it's not an essential more of a nice to have option. But if I can have that would be ideal.I never thought I would be seriously looking at buying a Rav4 though. Had one as a rental for a couple of weeks a few years ago and absolutely hated it. But the new version seems pretty much an all new vehicle with previous issues resolved or greatly improved.
no heated seats on any model unless you go cruiser or edge (leather options)
Jesse5788 writes...no heated seats on any model unless you go cruiser or edgeCorrect. Some dealerships will have sublet suppliers who can fit aftermarket heated seat kits to the GX or GXL, although Toyota Australia is pushing dealers away from fitting non-genuine stuff.
Going to look into the Techstream tonight, but have a few questions:1. Will playing around with it void warranty? 2. Is the cable the only thing I'd have to buy or is there a subscription required
Sekhmet114 writes...Going to look into the Techstream tonightPlease let us know how you go with it all, would be interested to see what can be done with Techstream.
I'm yet to get around to researching (or taking those photos sorry)Can anyone give me an idea of what Android Play would be like, in context to the current system? I've never used it before, so unsure of how much of the current Toyota system is 'replaced' ��� if at all
PinVidz, can you tell me where the cable connection port is located within the 2019 RAV4 hybrid?Cheers.Done a lot of customise options in Techstream including killing off the beeping when the power back door is operating, remote power window/roof open/close, 5 flashes instead of 3 for the auto indicators and a few other bits and pieces.
Does any one know if you can disable the beeping when using the boot does it require a dealer to configure?Also, has any one noticed that if the car is locked that you can't just hit the boot release on the remote to open it, you first need to unlock the car (same goes if waking up to car and pushing button on boot door)? Seems a bit strange and not good my previous Subaru Outback worked.
Wont see it until October in cars. They will arrive during October so its a big unknown until then. It will be a software upgrade done by dealer to new gen Rav and Hiace models. This is likely to follow in Corolla (new gen) and i would guess and say dealer upgrade at no charge and possibly Camry into the future.Why do i say this? Corolla is adding black roof option with car play standard from last qtr and i think Rav will follow with 2 tone roof option when the model reaches around the 1 year in the Aussie market.
jasonbau writes...Does any one know if you can disable the beeping when using the boot does it require a dealer to configure?It's a safety warning. Maybe a programming option. I'd expect most manufacturers and dealers will shy away from it though. I'm sure plenty have had their head knocked ��� with and without the beeping.

I've set mine so the power door can be remotely opened when the vehicle is locked (button requires holding for a few moments).

I can't guarantee. Personally say 42.5K is possible. If you track back this post, people did get 42+ during Jun/July.

I ordered a Cruiser 2WD Petrol through a novated lease a couple of weeks ago and dealer had said that stock on the way and wont be waiting for a build. The only details they gave me is i should have it late august to early-mid september.Was wondering if anyone else had a car inbound to Perth around that time and has any more details? Vessel/boat etc. I have asked the dealer but they say they cant give me a delivery date until it arrives in Freo, which seems odd to me.

jasonbau writes...Does any one know if you can disable the beeping when using the boot does it require a dealer to configure?You can just turn the beeping down or mute it via the options in on the main dash. It is under the settings part. I���m not near my car at the moment but I turned my beeping volume down a bit so not as loud.
Hey ��� It was through a leasing company, although i didn't shop around nor particular ask for a better price (i probably should have read this forum before hand). The price i got was about the same as on the website less GST i believe as its through the lease deal or something ��� $43k drive away (41.2k FBT value) including some accessories ��� tow pack, all weather boot mat, carpet mats, metalic paint.I was looking at the hybrid also, but just didn't want to wait 6 months and from what i have heard the petrol economy is quite good anyway

PinzVidz writes...You can only adjust volume via the instrument cluster. You need to use Techstream to mute it.Yes but the lowest volume on it is pretty hard to hear it. I don���t know why people are complaining about the sound it makes, I like it making the beeping noise.
Didn't ask any extra. Coz I am not going to do it. Awaiting to refinance the mortgage.Then I will do the lease.

You can get the details within a few days of ordering the car. Call the dealership and if they are unco-operative,follow the procedure to call Toyota I have described in the detailed instructions some posts back
Went to look at one yesterday and they are great keen on a AWD but guy told me nothing for 4-6 months.Nothing on car sales either in stock.These bad boys are selling fast with limited stock.I said I had a trade in he said go to back of the line everyone has cash.Looks like Apple marketing here.PM me if anyone in QLD  decided to cancel there order I might take it up.Great cars and brand.. Just need to find one now.

jnu123 writes...for a toyota?yes, I was surprised too. I called my local dealer to give him the chance to match it but he couldn't. The funny thing is both dealers working for the same company just different locations and departments.
I just ordered a Cruiser AWD Hybrid from another online car broker. I saved a few grand off what the local dealers were offering in Perth, but I wouldn't expect to get it any faster than an order straight from the dealer.Seems like 4-6 months is just what you need to wait at the moment.
I would recommend checking for available stock directly on the dealerships' websites instead. I just had a look around the dealerships around SE Qld and found a bunch of AWD GXs (all in glacier white) and three AWD GXLs. Every now and then you will get some cars coming into stock which are, for whatever reason, unspoken for.
Can vouch for motorscout as well. Got a Hybrid for a pretty much unbeatable price (-5%) in Sydney. They use fleet dealers rather than normal salesmen.

Guys, just browsing online, one dealer, advertising for 2wd GXL Rav4 Petrol (in stock) for $37,090 including metallic paint, that's the start of price war. original price on toyota website, $40,049 , 7.4% discount.
I think there's a lot more discounts on Petrol because dealers have them in stock. I found the 2L petrol version pretty meh in comparison.5% off is definitely good for the Hybrid, not much incentive for dealers to do discounts when so many people want them.
Guys looking at getting 2019 Rav4 GX 2.0L petrol model in Auto and the Eclecic Blue... On Toyota website price is $37,288... Anyone find a better deal at any dealership in Sydney? Haven't bought a brand new car so don't know how much wiggle room I have...
A few grand off? Wow how much did you end up paying?
Very happy with the car so far. We got the hybrid GLX.It's done 4500 kms and is averaging 5.1 litres per hundred kms.Also, got to tow a boat the other week and it was averaging 10.1 litres per hundred ��� which is amazing!!DavidandJen
jnu123 writes...any accessories? cargo mat, tint, metallic paint?-5% is not that good.Premium color, Full tank, privacy boot and mats. Right now on Toyota website, it shows $42,953. This was also the price quoted to me by other dealers. They weren't budging on the price whatsoever.From motorscout, I got the car for $40225 drive away. Not earth shattering but certainly better to save something than nothing.
jnu123 writes...any accessories? cargo mat, tint, metallic paint?-5% is not that good.You���re kidding right? 5% is excellent given they have little incentive to discount when they are moving them so easily

Hi Everyone,Just wondering if anyone has recently bought 2WD GX Hybrid in sydney? And how much discount did you manage to get? Whats the wait like for hybrids in Sydney?

Moji91 writes...Not sure whether mentioning dealer names allowed in this forum but if it is than can someone recommend a dealer in sydney thats helpful and easy to deal with?Above Acacer mentioned in stock gx hybrid is a not bad 'in stock price'.If you can wait, 4-6 months, aim at least 6% discount.
Finally been told my car is being built but will not be available before October which pee es me as my trade in is due to be refegistered at end of September so they will get almost 3 months free rego on the car. Still happy to hear it���s finally being built. Yay
the_rats_girl writes...will get almost 3 months free rego on the car.Remaining rego is usually factored into the trade in value. Ask them to cover it
How do you talk deals on the hybrids if they are trading in but it won���t be ready for 6 months? Will dealers usually talk change over figure? They have said they will honour the trade In price but I wanna make sure we get a bit of a discount off the new car too. Or do we just talk them down on the new car price instead ?
mpk- writes...Remaining rego is usually factored into the trade in value. Ask them to cover itThis. When the CHR first came out, my mate got a discount worth 6 months rego (Qld min is 6 months) because the rego would be up before the car could be delivered.

Thanks yep happy to bargain new car price down or talk ���change over��� figure instead of easier. Not going to go down the path of privately selling it. Too much hassle and will be without a car if it sellls before the car is built
I saw a Silver Service cab Rav4 earlier.  There must be a lot of fleet buyers thats why is the delay in orders.
Or maybe it's just popular..
It could be both.  If it was available early this year I might have ordered one too.

Just ordered our Hybrid ????????????????So happy and happy with our deal too. Got a good changeover fee. They let us keep our trade in car until the new one arrives and will honour the changeover fee/tradein fee. Now to wait... Dealer says 6-9 months
Wow... 6-9months. I wonder would there be an over supply if the 2020 model is released with improved features and people start cancelling their 2019 orders.One thing I noticed is the US versions have painted fenders on the top tier hybrids... Why do SUV these days all use plastic :(
GXL now 36,490 drive away, QLD dealer, in stock
Effortless ��� but the boat/trailer was under 1 tonne.Just amazed how well it holds the speed going up hills without having the kickback as it drops down gears. Absolutely love it.
Found the auto high beams to be beyond annoying. Anyway to adjust the sensitivity?
We turned the feature off ��� might  be good in country driving but not for metro
It was good when a car actually showed up. But so often it would pick up reflectors and switch on and off the whole drive. The delay when they came back on after a car passed was a tad annoying because another car would show up just as they went back on and looked like i was flashing my lights at them
I got few questions regarding fuel economy of hybrid versions:1. What are you getting when you are driving at 110k for long distances like 200kms?2. Is there difference of fuel economy between 2wd and AWD hybrids as well on highway trips?3. Can you disable AWD and put in 2wd mode on hybrids?4. I do not go off road, and doesn't have boat etc to trail, do I really need AWD? Or other way asking is AWD better on corners/handling on City or Highway roads than 2wd, or 2wd will be same experience?Thx
I bought a 2wd GXL Hybrid1. Over long distances  I get 5.8ltrs per 100k mostly motorway driving.2. I haven't seen any comments that say that there is a difference3. I doubt you can disable it. The  ev mode kicks in as the  computer sees fit.4. I don't go off road nor do I tow so I don't see any point in carting the extra weight and paying the extra money. As for handling I find the 2wd hybrid handles really well.So really with point 4 if you don't need awd  there's no point in paying for it.

If I'm waiting for 6-9 months, I'd rather see what gems are coming in as part of the new import laws that will open up the Hybrid market even wider.
Just bought GXL 2WD Petrol in Graphite Grey for 36,500. So happy right now. Can't wait for it to be delivered in 2 weeks time.
I wanted to ask if anyone can report on delays beyond promised delivery dates on *existing* RAV4 orders ��� especially Hybrids.I signed and placed a deposit for a 2WD Cruiser Hybrid RAV4 on 24th July. At that time I was estimated build month of Oct and delivery by 31Oct2019, so under 3.5 months total.I called my Sydney-based dealer this week, alarmed at stories that new orders are at 6+ months wait.He told me "no change" to my delivery.So has anyone else had a July purchase/ October delivery date bumped yet?
What does the Toyota Tracking System sayhttps://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/I ordered in May with estimated delivery end Aug early Sept, picked up last Friday so spot on. Was able to track from 'scheduled production' right through to 'at the dealer being readied'
The web tracking does not yet list a production month. The dealer said that would only appear within 30 days of production. Is that BS?
baliset writes...So has anyone else had a July purchase/ October delivery date bumped yet?Hey Baliset,We placed our order around you (possibly a week or 2 later) and we were given a December delivery. On top of that they are refusing to give access to tracking (Have tried the help guide earlier in the thread and nothing). Even tried getting the broker involved. Either way the way assuming that the December date is correct it is a much longer wait then yours so I would say either my guys are being slow on purpose or your guys are being optimistic. (Mine was a AWD cruiser hybrid though)
baliset writes...The dealer said that would only appear within 30 days of production.Sounds like you have access to the system. Yes, I think the scheduled production for the month is updated in the first week of the month.....
baliset writes...So has anyone else had a July purchase/ October delivery date bumped yet?No, we ordered a RAV4 AWD Cruiser Hybrid in July and are still promised an October *build* date, although they say it's most likely November delivery by the time it arrives. Hoping that's still the case.
Hi guys,I went to test drive Cruiser Hybrid  2WD here on Sunshine Coast, Qld.I���m pretty keen to go ahead and pay deposit to order one (Pearl white) once I���ve checked a few things this week. There���s no rush as I���m aware of the wait period, but obviously don���t want to wait weeks before passing on my order... The pressure I was under to sign a contract after I test drove was ridiculous! So much that it turned me off and I���ll purchase elsewhere.One thing I didn���t understand is their price came up higher then what Toyota have on their own website($45700) post code entered correctly, but dealer came up with $46100!Also would be possible to find out what other people paid for their cruiser 2WD hybrid in SE Qld? Doesn���t look like there���s much margin for negotiation, am I wrong?Thanks for your input,Cheers guys.Pat
Zappa Scutinizer writes...Thanks for your input,Will Send a PM.
I'll be waiting until next year, did bank on doing something early on the year but suspect the current waiting times won't be easing up then it gets to a point do you get something else such as another CX-5 like I have or wait for the next model which hopefully has things which I feel was left out ie cooling seats and HUD just as an example.
Hi everyone, anyone here who wanted to get a hybrid opted for a petrol instead because of the wait times? Is it worth waiting for the hybrid you guys think? Now seriously considering the cruiser petrol or maybe a cx5
Hi everyone, anyone here who wanted to get a hybrid opted for a petrol instead because of the wait times?I've thought seriously about this. Are we so incapable of delayed gratification we can't wait? Yes, a multi-month wait for a purchase anyone would find exciting is frustrating. Maybe I'm just wired to regard a compromise at this stage as something that would put a dampener on the whole experience. It would dog me for the duration of my ownership.The car I'm trading in is a Forester I bought new in 2004. Based on the infrequency of these purchases for me, I'm kinda committed to getting exactly what I want.
attila8 writes...anyone here who wanted to get a hybrid opted for a petrol instead because of the wait times?Was considering a Cruiser Hybrid AWD primarily for the tow rating, but also features. Had a HiLux to trade which the km were starting to get too high, plus sick of the DPF dramas. Plenty of Edges in stock around the country, so opted for one of those instead to keep the AWD/higher tow rating. Ventilated seats in the Edge is a bonus and is the only variant to get the feature. A25A-FKS 2.5L is a beautiful engine, matched nicely with the 8 speed auto. Best tank to tank economy so far is 7.4L/100km (mostly 80-110km/h driving).
baliset writes...Hi everyone, anyone here who wanted to get a hybrid opted for a petrol instead because of the wait times?I went with the Cruiser Petrol. It drove fine to me on the test. I think you also need to consider the additional cost of the hybrid and how much you actually drive. as the guy above has mentioned the economy of the petrol models are still really good (Hybrid 4.7 comb, Petrol Cruiser 6.5 comb). When i worked out that i was only likely to do about 10,000km per year, thats an additional 180L of petrol per year for the cruiser based on the combined averages. Even at $1.40/L thats only an additional $250/year on petrol. Based on this the buy back for the hybrid option seemed too long to me (10 years) plus it will have additional costs for servicing and battery replacements eventually.If your driving 20k-30k per year its obviosuly much more cost effective to go with the hybrid, hence why i have seen some Rav4 hybrid taxi's in Perth.

I couldnt justify the extra 2-3K for a Hybrid based on my usage.
Just phoned my local dealer here in Adelaide.I was interested in the Rav 4 Hybrid Cruiser, however, I was given a delivery date of twelve (12 months)!Not waiting that long!
12 months? That's ridiculous... I ordered mine 3 weeks ago and was told today it will go into production in Nov.  I wonder if each dealership has a limited quota for each shipment...
Had a test drive today. Nice car but I���m struggling with Toyata���s packaging. The Edge should be the premium version but no hybrid and no drivers seat memory when you can get them in the next level down? Why?
Picking up Rav4 Cruiser AWD this afternoon woohoo! After a wait of 3months and 2 weeks.
Enjoy the car.Had mine for the last 4 weeks.
Wrrr writes...Picking up Rav4 Cruiser AWD this afternoon woohoo! After a wait of 3months and 2 weeks.Awesome. What colour
The Edge should be the premium version but no hybrid and no drivers seat memory when you can get them in the next level down? Why?Here's my sexist guess: Seat memory (x2) is a selling point for a 'his and hers' vehicle. The Edge variant is, perhaps, pitched at younger single guys who are less interested in such things?
Mollusc writes...The Edge should be the premium version but no hybrid and no drivers seat memory when you can get them in the next level down?

Im assuming they couldnt fit the hybrid with suitable front and rear diff, let alone water crossing with electric motors and batteries.
This car just got on my radar. Had no interest previously. Quick questions.Is the 2 colour with the white  roof (or black) available in Aus on the Edge spec?Can the Edge spec get the light colour interior trim that the US variant Adventure gets?Thanks!
Duraz writes...Is the 2 colour with the white  roof (or black) available in Aus on the Edge spec?Not available hereCan the Edge spec get the light colour interior trim that the US variant Adventure gets?Had a look and options are either Black with orange accents or Brown & Grey with orange accents

When reversing my Cruiser AWD, there seems to be no predictive curve lines on the reverse camera to predict my path. Is that true for other Cruiser AWD owners? Is there a way to change this?
Also is there a way to turn on the camera when the car is just in park and not in reverse?
WrrrMine has the predictive lines. When you have the reverse select bottom left off the screenThere is a button with different lines push it and change the guidelinesRe cameraPut it park and press the camera button on the right side next to the steering wheel
Hi Marlin,I have the two options ��� the fixed straight guidelines, and the curvy but fixed guidelines.By predictive guidelines, I mean the curves are animated and actually move and become tighter or less tight as you turn the steering wheel.Does your guidelines move with turning of the steering wheel? If not then maybe it���s just not a feature. Can you confirm?
Hi WrrrWhen I back up I have a yellow grid turn the wheel and the yellow grid will bend Under neath the yellow grid I have 2 blue lines witch stay straight.
Hi Wrrr,I had the same problem, where no yellow guide lines are displayed.Do you have "!" displayed on the screen, i think at the bottom left (or right, couldn't remember) when rear view monitor is active?If so, try the solution suggested on page 169 of multimedia system owner's manual. In my case, i had to get the dealer to reset it.
Exactly right. Thanks Espirito. I will try that myself first. Will see how I go.
Ok, so there���s all this write up about Entune 3.0 and being able to remote start the car. Is it an Aussie thing or just some American fad ? Does it work for us here in Oz?
No remote start for Toyota in Australia.In the States you need Entune plus to have that feature.
Any one heard any thing in regards to Apple carplay. I read some where a while back that this will be rolled out in the last quarter of 2019 but no news since.
Was considering a Cruiser Hybrid AWD primarily for the tow rating, but also features. Had a HiLux to trade which the km were starting to get too high, plus sick of the DPF dramas.

Moji91 writes...Any one heard any thing in regards to Apple carplay.

This was his response:In regards to Apple air Play/Android auto we will be updating all our customers who want this  free of charge in November, as software is available end October.Hopefully that is the case but this dealer is still stuffing me around with delivery so who knows. They had said late August delivery, then the last day of august (after me emailing weekly for weeks) he tells me it hasn't been shipped and is still in Japan.
jacknomiz writes...Hi PinzVidz, your fuel consumption is in the city or combined?I guess you'd say combined (mostly highway, some city). The figure I indicated was calculated from trip meter reset/litres filled, not the displayed total average, which I've never reset from new. It's showing 7.8L/100km presently.I work nightshift and when I'm driving home with no-one on the road, I take it nice and easy averaging about 70km/h over about 16km. When I shut down the MID shows L/100km for the last trip. Best I've seen is 6.3L/100km.
Yeah, not bad figures for a not so light car. So city would be around 9L/100km I guess.With such long waiting times for the hybrid, I'm thinking about getting Edge. I don't think I do that many km to justify hybrid, but want the power of a 2.5L engine.
I've been told January and that was ordering it at the start of August, around the same time. Either there is a different wait time on each dealership or your sales are making it up...
Worldguyfc writes...Either there is a different wait time on each dealership or your sales are making it up...Each dealer does get their own allocation which will differ based on a number of criteria, so depending on how many orders they have yet to be fulfilled the wait time will vary between dealers.
Going to check out a demo hybrid tomorrow with less than 1k kms... What sort of discount do i expect to get given that it is rarely in stock? 10%? 5% from the list price?

Can someone please let me know if the Hybrid Cruiser AWD comes with Panoramic view monitor?
Currently have the dealer spec sheet in front of me (looking to order a Edge this week) and can confirm it lists the panoramic view monitor.The only thing you don't get is the 18" gloss black rims instead of the 19" alloys.And the only thing the edge has exclusive is the exterior trim (Which can't mount a nudge bar), softex faux leather vs leather accented seats, downhill assist, torque vectoring diff and the offroad select dial (essentially a fancy VSC off switch) and a 2.0 FWD instead of a 2.5 AWD.
Thanks scarecrow. I thought the Edge has a 2.5L engine just like the Hybrid AWD
Wrrr writes...I thought the Edge has a 2.5L engine just like the Hybrid AWDIt does. The Edge is AWD, 2.5L.https://www.toyota.com.au/-/media/toyota/main-site/vehicle-hubs/rav4/files/rav4-spec-data-may2019.pdf
A couple of things to consider if looking at the Edge:1. The current model has the smallest boot of any medium SUV. Comical in fact. My small hatch has a bigger boot capacity.2. A new generation Edge will be on sale in 2020. It will be just like the new Rav4 (2.5L hybrid with optional AWD and improved interior space and design thanks to a new chassis and drive-train) but with a much bigger battery (9 times the size!), optional plug-in and optional high-power 2.0T engine.The equivalent PHEV Rav4 isn't due to come out until 2025!
Is Viper talking about the Ford Edge? I think the conversation was about the Rav4 Edge.
Viper writes...A couple of things to consider if looking at the Edge:I have a feeling you're confusing the Rav4 Edge variant (that others are talking about) with the Ford Edge.
My bad.Either way, something to consider for people interested in hybrid's and facing a 6 month wait; a better alternative may be here by the time your 6-month wait has passed.
Well didn���t really have many km on it, so nothing really but we were well looked after with the accessories. Couple of freebies and others at cost.Someone beat me to the demo cruiser 2wd hybrid unfortunately.. Guy placed a deposit without even seeing it.. It went for $47800 so not too miffed about it
That���s a lot for a 2wd Cruiser hybrid .
I've been told by my dealer that they are getting one 2wd hybrid cruiser a month and I'm 5th in line. He said it'll probably be April before I get it. This is ordering late May, so it'll be about 12 months since ordering...
Hi Vincent26I ordered my AWD Hybrid CRUISER on the 24rd of May.Build date was the 3rd July. Pickup was the  31/7Maybe I just was lucky. The dealer got 2 AWD In that day.

Yes it does. To the right below  the steering wheel is a button with a camera symbols on it.
Yes it does. It has all the full panoramic function and rotates the car in 3D view including an option to make the car see through. Thanks guys.Also, thanks so much for the advice on how get the yellow predictive dynamic guidelines on the reverse monitor. I listened to your advice and turned the steering wheel full left then full right. Having the car stationary while doing this did not fix it. I actually had to go for a drive and do a few full circle turns in both directions before the system recognised the full limits of th3 steering and then was able to bring the dynamic guidelines up on the screen.

The Ford Escape plug in will be well over 50k by the time it arrives. I'd rather keep the change, buy the rav hybrid and not have to deal with visiting a Ford service department.
Finally have an eta for my car. 13/10. I am so excited only / months overdue
Sorry 2 months overdue
Congrats rats, when did you order?
30 May. Supposed to be delivered by 30 august
Never transacted with Toyota before. Are discounts achievable on the Edge model for a car ordered to spec not in stock? I gather wait times on the Hybrids may negate any negotiation but how about on the Edge? I have no interest in the Hybrid.
Very interested in a hybrid cruiser 4wd (cash in hand) but just got told by the salesperson I saw today that there is currently a twelve month wait. By that time I assume a new upgrade would be available so I would be paying for an outdated model. The waiting list on the Edge is about four months. However, I was also assured that Toyota are ramping up production soon and they are expected waiting lists to come down. A new Subaru Outback with turbo is stating to look better and better!
BCMS writes...By that time I assume a new upgrade would be available so I would be paying for an outdated model.There won't be a facelift until at least 2022 or 2023.The waiting list on the Edge is about four months.There are a fair few Edges in the country. Ask the dealer to jump onto SAP and have a look to see what's available.
Yep, I went and looked at that model and was told there is a significant wait. The interesting part in it all, is the customers are willing to hand their money over for larger vehicles that are really economical with fuel. This clearly indicates that people are fed up with fuel companies gouging them at the pump.
Percy writes...This clearly indicates that people are fed up with fuel companies gouging them at the pump.Exactly why I'm in line for a Hybrid Cruiser. I absolutely hate filling up.I've been waiting for a couple of years for a reasonable electric SUV, but when I did a test drive of the Hyundai Kona EV it was just way too small and the price literally double the petrol model. The Model X isnt really economical or practical and the Kia eNiro isn't going to be much different from the Kona.I figure I'll stick with the Hybrid for a few years and hopefully theres more development in the market.
correct me if I am wrong, if there is 12 months waiting on hybrid models, it doesn't mean order placed today, and car picked up a year later will be built say sept 19?I assume it will be still built closer to delivery date... which considering the sea freight from Thailand (i assume these are built) would be max a month off, comes to aug 2020 built and delivered in sept 2020
Somethingnew writes...I assume it will be still built closer to delivery date...I think that is a very safe assumption LOL, unless there is a compelling reason to build a car then hang onto it for 12 months before delivering it. Seems that demand really is that strong, I saw a figure somewhere, maybe here, that US sales were 60000 last month........I think the Toyota production line would be something to behold, would love a video of it.So glad I ordered mine back on 11 May, first day of release (delivered 30 Aug)

AWD Hybrid Cruiser ��� wow!! This car gets more impressive by the day ��� I just found out last night that the seat settings can be programmed to each of the two keys.

Any price recommendation for GX Hybrid 2WD CVT in Perth? Thanks.
However, the lumber support adjustment cannot be saved. Wonder why?
Wrrr writes...Wonder why?I think they tend to be a little air bag that inflates, so probably its not trivial to detect how inflated it is and store it.
I was wondering about this. I asked the local dealer and he said it didn���t have seat memory for the key fob. But if as you say it does it���s a bonus. I thought it may as some other models do. Another bonus in my book Sorry. This was directed at wrrrr
My 2013 Xc60 has this feature. Toyota have been slow to catch up with many features except reliability.

When did you order yours?

I ordered my Saturn Blue 2WD Cruiser Hybrid on 24/7 and received contract paperwork saying build "mid October" and delivery around "31/10".I called my Sydney dealer this morning with the anecdotal evidence that many people having ordered in May/Jun/July are now being told of delays, and worried that now I'm within a month of the putative build date, the online portal still lists no build month estimate.His response was curious: He dismissed the accuracy of the portal. Even said he had no idea how it worked and that it's totally separate to their own system, which still says "mid October".The only change he's claiming to see on his system is to the "product code" compared to July, which he interprets as the advent of cars with CarPlay compatibility built in.I still get a strong sense I'm being strung along. I'm baffled at the idea there are two systems, or that he could have zero knowledge of Toyota's own customer tracking portal. I'm very curious what experience people here have had ��� how far before manufacture does the "build month" field actually get populated?

CheersOrdered the same car but in White at the same time as you. Initial delivery was supposed to be September and then "possibly" December. Update from the dealer yesterday after some more enquiries within Toyota now suggest it will definately be 2020 delivery. I get the feeling it might be a 2019 build but delivered in 2020 which means already a year old as far as resale goes. I hope that doesn't happen but no control over the process.Toyota have told their dealers that anyone ordering a RAV4 now will be waiting 12 months.

Does anyone have any feedback on putting opticoat pro on the rav4? Have a detailer that quoted me 795 plus 495 for the ceramic tint... 1095 if i choose opticoat pro+
Has anyone taken the car in for first service yet? What���s the latest on Apple CarPlay?Car running like a dream so far and put together solid as a rock.I���m taking mine in for first service early October
So with Toyota not using real leather for their seats. What is the long term durability of the substitute synthetic material they use?
Macca what an absolute joke!! This has made my first new car buying experience rubbish. Spoke to the dealer again yesterday and he said he is going to email their stick controller to find out what���s going on. If they tell me December I���m going in to get my deposit back!
Wrrr writes...Has anyone taken the car in for first service yet? What���s the latest on Apple CarPlay?Yes, just the usual checks for complimentary service.Apple CarPlay still most likely mid to late October ��� but the dealer will be the one to make contact when it is available.

If they tell me December I���m going in to get my deposit back!Yes I believe my dealer also spoke to the internal ordering people to get the latest. It all seems a bit of a lottery as to how long each person waits for their delivery. I guess it has something to do with obviously when the order was placed but also the model.I will keep on waiting as I thought this car was the pick of the brands tested in that price range as well as the other RAV4 models.I do however realise that everyone cannot wait and will take the best option for themselves. All the best with your decision.
Prius c i-tech also uses Softex, any trade-ins I used to see at Toyota the material never showed any wear/year and seemed pretty durable. Can't comment on the Softex in my Edge yet, it's only a month old.
Dealer called today to apologise over delay. White Cruiser AWD Hybrid ordered on 1 June and the latest advice from Toyota is that production is pushed back to November build with hopes of delivery in December (maybe). Very apologetic, but she explained that global demand for the Hybrid is so remarkable that there is no hope of keeping up.Not a great concern for me as I had factored some lead time into the purchase decision but would be frustrating for many who want/need delivery sooner.
Thanks scarecrow. I thought the Edge has a 2.5L engine just like the Hybrid AWDDoh! You are correct. I mixed up the petrol cruiser and the petrol edge in my post.As inside note, I'm wondering what prices people are setting for at the moment?I've dropped a deposit on a Edge today for a drive away of 50,500 (Inc pano roof and metalic paint) which the sales guy claimed is a net loss to them of $300 on the car until they get their incentives from Toyota.Does anyone have any feedback on putting opticoat pro on the rav4? Have a detailer that quoted me 795 plus 495 for the ceramic tint... 1095 if i choose opticoat pro+You can get opticoat or any other plethora of pain protection products added by a authorised detailer for <$600. And to be honest, the only difference is your car will look like it's been waxed recently. It doesn't do much for protection. Modern vehicles already have multiple layers of clear coat as it is. If you're the kind of person to wash your car frequently and wax it/use sealant then there's better places to spend your money.Despite what they claim it won't protect against scratches or marks.For something that will actually protect against damage you could get a clear bra put on for the same price.Same goes for tinting, in my personal experience dealer installed tint has always been shoddy as far as fit and finish and overpriced by at least $100 as well as being restricted by their product of the month. Go to a private detailer/tint installer and pick a film and opacity that's better suited than a mix match of opacity around the car.
Thanks for the input... Might just go for the tint then.. I plan on doing the waxing myself but if i get eventually lazy might do the opticoatFor something that will actually protect against damage you could get a clear bra put on for the same price.... What does this mean?
scarecrow398 writes...I've dropped a deposit on a Edge today for a drive away of 50,500 (Inc pano roof and metalic paint)Full tilt is around $53,500, you've got a decent deal there, considering Toyota aren't offering much in the way of incentives to dealers (yet).
For something that will actually protect against damage you could get a clear bra put on for the same price.... What does this mean?A clear bra is a protective plastic film made by 3M that can be applied to the car which will protect against impacts and provides a self healing film to the car. Similar to a phone screen protector.Here's a comparison https://youtu.be/5mhmg4DPhBoA clear bra typically ranges from $400-$1100 depending on how much coverage you want. Generally a front bumper and bonnet is $400-700.

Hey All,Just reading the thread on wheel alignment issue that someone has with the Rav 4. Any other owners having that issue?
Unsure if its been mentioned through the thread, sorry if so, but whats peoples thoughts on the idea of the "edge" version not having 2 person memory for the electric drivers seat?  The model below cruiser does and they have negated this in the higher specced edge? Now there are bugger all are cruisers around, and my local dealer has the edge in the colour I like , but to me its real handy to have memory position as my wife and I both will drive the car regularly.  ( first world problems I know )Is there a reason they have done this? Cheers.

but whats peoples thoughts on the idea of the "edge" version not having 2 person memory for the electric drivers seat?Completely stupid as far as I was concerned. The "premium" vehicle should have all the bells and whistles.
Mollusc writes...Completely stupid as far as I was concerned. The "premium" vehicle should have all the bells and whistles.Not only that, I don't know why the Edge doesn't have a HUD? The Corolla ZR has it, why doesn't the Edge have it?
My thoughts too. Not that I want to spend that much but I���d prefer the cruiser with this feature rather than the edge without it. It���s practical for me and my other half. We drive in two totally different positions.  I asked them at Toyota but they didn���t have any real reason other than the edge may be aimed at single blokes with money to spend ? Still seems weird to drop something from the top of the line model.Sorry that was for mollusc. Unsure how to quote.

No problems here. Steering well in adaptive cruise control.
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner writes...Any 2019 RAV4 owner have Steering Wheel or Alignment issue?I can see how some owners using LTA would think that this is the case.  The car will try to center itself in the lane and not everyone is probably comfortable with where the car 'thinks' the center is.  I wasn't at first.Once you come to terms with where the car wants to sit on the road, the LTA does a great job and there's no need to fight it.Non issue.
acacer writes...No issues ��� plus if it was a big issue across the board you would think there would be more people complaining not only locally but also internationally?Looked like, my RAV4 steering wheel issue (not self centering) on my RAV4 is just an individual case, rather than mass production issue. It could be imprecise assembly in factory. Especially, I can see the KingPin Angle and caster angel are all out of specs range even dealer has attempted to repairs by 4 wheel alignment done���.but kingpin, caster angle cannot be changed by that simple alignment. It could also be due to other factor mixed up, steering rack, column, pinion, sensor, angle sensor, position sensor......etc.No reason dealer can still claim that the condition exhibited in my RAV4 is normal operational characteristic of the BRAND NEW Rav 4, but the fact that it is not. I am still arguing with dealer, it may have manufacturing defect.I have hired an independent vehicle inspection company to carry out an inspection test, to confirm that my RAV4 steering wheel constantly toward to the left at all road conditions.Purchasing a brand new vehicle, supposedly should not have so much trouble. Otherwise, why not go for a second hand car without manufacture warranty.
Placed an order for AWD Cruiser Hybrid on 10 July.  Received a call today saying delivery has blown out to May.  Initial estimates at order were ���6 months��� and I received a call a few weeks back saying it was on track for November build.  Not sure what���s happened. :(

Does anyone know any more details around the CarPlay update? I know Toyota mentioned towards the end of the year but wanting to see if there is anything more specific.

The dealer should know new vehicle owner will not accept a defective vehicle.I'm sure we all understand you are frustrated but you don't need to keep posting about it here ��� we have seen the thread, all the posts etc. and to be honest there is nothing any of us here can do or say to make things better.Maybe a different course of action can be taken, post on the dealers social media sites, email them daily, call them daily ��� worst case maybe you can even picket at the site and kick up a storm until they do what you want them to do.What I am trying to say is do something so that they can see or hear about it daily, instead of on here.Posting on here will do nothing, the dealer isnt on here and it is starting to annoy a lot of people based on many of the replies and sarcastic comments you are getting.
Has anyone gotten a cargo net or similar for the 2 rear cargo hooks?I've never bought anything of the sort so was looking for some guidance what works; at this stage I've got a 45l portable fridge that I want to secure in the boot for shopping, as it slides around a bit...
I think there are some serious issue with this 2019 RAV 4 , that probable is the reason why delivery times are so blown out, looks like Toyota are fixing some known issues like transmission in petrol version , high cabin noise  in both hybrid and petrol or can be anything else .The 2 liter petrol models make more noise than my  2005 Honda Jazz.For those of us who are waiting it looks like it's a blessing, as we might end if with above issue ironed out or in the end at least have an option to cancel .
DipenK writes...I think there are some serious issue with this 2019 RAV 4 , that probable is the reason why delivery times are so blown outNo, the reason delivery times are blowing out is because these things are selling like hot cakes, globally. They simply can't make enough of them.
Hi all. I am new to this blog, so please be nice. I have been watching the discussions with a lot of interest and thought I���d share my own experience. I ordered my AWD Cruiser hybrid end of July 2019 when the dealer advised he had one in pearl white coming in by the end of August. I had them include in the contract that if the car was not delivered by 31/08 that I could ask for my deposit back. Low and behold, three weeks ago I got a call to say the car was ready and I collected it on 2/09. Reading the stories of the long waits etc I can���t help but think I have been so lucky. But then again luck had nothing with it. I paid $48.5 k for the car with rubber mat for the back and wind deflectors on all 4 windows and carpets. I probably paid over premium ( and someone got bumped) but I am delighted with the car and don���t mind if I did pay over.
I'm concerned about the inconsistent delivery dates people are getting for their (mostly Hybrid) RAV4s. Ordered 10 July, delivery May 2020? Ordered end July, delivered early Sept?My 2wd cruiser hybrid ordered 24 July, promised by 31/10, has not been allocated a build month and Toyota's central customer service line (not the dealer) says it will stay that way until some database shows a status change.What we're seeing here might be a mismatch between stock pre-ordered and committed to dealers in advance, and then orders for which a car simply has to be built-to-order (eg some specific combination of colour, spec and interior trim).I think prospective RAV4 owners are mature people who accept that a popular new model will incur a wait. However, I think Toyota are failing customers by not even giving everyone an accurate picture of the wait. I now have very little confidence that my dealer is giving me accurate information. Whatever keeps us on the hook.
DipenK writes...high cabin noise  in both hybrid and petrol or can be anything else .HI mate. I drove the 2l petrol cruiser and noticed a high amount of noise , more than i would have expected.They mentioned it may be just possible road noise, but this cruiser I drove had " wind noise". It was definately coming through a window as though it wasn't sealed properly ( yes all were up tight ) , mind you  this was at 100 KM out of town and we only do a couple of trips away a year. in town was fine.but it put me off a bit. Then drove the hybrid which had the window visors on it and it was noticeably quieter, but still not as quiet as I ammused a 40k car would be?. mind you I have a petrol cruiser on order and have the 3-4 month ( or longer ) wait like heaps of others ( probs put the window visors on just because. But as mentioned they may iron out a few issues from previous builds with the new ones getting built.
Hi PinzVidz. Have you had any more luck with the folding and unfolding of the car mirrors using Techstream? I was on the net and read about Carista App which lists the new RAV4 as one of the cars in which the app works and specifically the automatic mirror thing. Has anyone else heard of and/or used Carista? Looks good but requires an outlay of close to $100 for the gizmo and the app subscription.  Thanks.
I have booked 2WD GXL Hybrid, my main reason was the fuel economy of the hybrid model and the looks compared to Honda CRV and Mazda CX5, I have compromised on the cabin noise as  we drive mainly in the city .My was ordered on last week of July and have been advised a delivery date of 19/11. Previously I was advised 9/11, it keeps changing .It feels like buying a lottery , you never know when you will get lucky.Now wait and hope to get a car with no defects.Drove a  Honda CRV current model(with turbo AWD) from Perth to Cervantes, its was really nice to drive and the cabin was quiet as well , does not feel like you are driving a CVT .Fuel consumption was around 9 litres /100kms.
BigMick63 writes...Have you had any more luck with the folding and unfolding of the car mirrorsI've found that folding them in when parking is the go.  Switch off the power and then click the mirror switch back to open.Nothing happens of course, until you start the car again :-).
Feathers, do you mean manually pressing the lock and unlock button? Or was Techstream successful in making the mirrors fold when you turn the ignition on and off? Thanks.
Although the options are available in Techstream, they have no effect on making the mirrors auto fold. Will look at either sourcing a kit from Japan, or just hacking with a couple of changeover relays.
Thanks PinzVidz. Have you heard of Carista? I emailed them to confirm their product would work on my car for what I want it for. This is their response:  ���Thanks for your interest in Carista! Yes, we have a feature for auto fold side-view mirrors via remote. I am not sure whether your specific vehicle supports it, though. We offer 1-month free trial of the subscription with the purchase of our device. Also, please note that we can return the adapter to Amazon within 30 days. So, you have options if you are not satisfied with the product.���Thinking of going down that path but do you think that connecting it and making changes to the car could void the warranty?
Have heard of them, but not sure why they need a "subscription" to operate...You won't void a vehicle's warranty. A vehicle manufacturer may reject a warranty claim on something that is damaged by the aftermarket product.
Exactly my concern. I can sign up for a month at $15 and buy the adapter for $40. But I was hoping to hear from people who might have used it to see if it will do what it says on its web page.
BigMick63 writes...do you mean manually pressing the lock and unlock button?No, unfortunately not.  When I park, the engine / radio etc are all on.  I fold the mirrors in...then turn the car off.Switch the mirrors back to 'open' Do what I have to do and then when I get back into the car, the mirrors will fold out as soon as I press the 'Start' button.   Hope that makes sense.It's not a fix, just a workaround for now.
Feathers writes...Switch the mirrors back to 'open' Do what I have to do and then when I get back into the car, the mirrors will fold out as soon as I press the 'Start' button.   Hope that makes sense.This what I do now and honestly it doesnt take few seconds. Got into a habit nowBefore I keep forgetting but now before i park, close/fold the mirror. Turn off the car. Open the mirror.When I turn the car on. The mirror opens. No problem.Turn off lane assist. Never care about it anyway.Reduce the boot volume down. Set window to close via remote incase I forget to close when car was on.Only issues I have is the touch screen. The glare is so bad you cant really see the display while trying to park.
Hi #Tonez. How do you get the windows to close with the remote? Is this by using Techstream? Can you also get them to open via remote? Thanks.
My Dealer activated global opening and closing.
BigMick63 writes...How do you get the windows to close with the remote? Is this by using Techstream? Can you also get them to open via remote?Yes.  Just ask the dealer to activate it on your first service, or if it isn't here yet have them do it before delivery.

Wazza77 writes...does this still put the windows up or do you need to use the lock button on keys?No ��� smart entry is separate.  The auto up/down window function is tied to long press on the key fob, lock/unlock respectively.

What about with the smart entry where you dont use the key fob at all, and just press the sensor on the door to lock the car?? does this still put the windows up or do you need to use the lock button on keys?Once the feature is set in Techstream, you can open or close the windows (and sunroof) from a distance with the fob. Ideal on a hot day when the car is parked in the sun ��� as you're approaching the car, hold down unlock on the fob to open everything up and let some of the heat out.
Feathers writes...The auto up/down window function is tied to long press on the key fob, lock/unlock respectively.Gotcha, cheers mate. Im being lazy now as im looking forward to smart entry and not getting keys out!.but sounds very usual.
PinzVidz writes...Once the feature is set in Techstream, you can open or close the windows (and sunroof) from a distance with the fob.Ta mate. As mentioned is this something the techs can do at service? My car isn't even built yet ( as just about everyone ! ) but it would be a great feature to have. Get to the car and the heat has already dissappated.This process is going to teach me patience. But am looking forward to my first brand new car. As a few others have mentioned I found the demo 2L petrol a bit  noisy over 80kms, wind noise was an issue from the drivers window, but in the hybrid it was better, mind you it had the wind visors on. Not sure if it was a one off, or not. But i have read of a few others mentioning them being a bit noisy. Ill see how i go in 3-4 months i spose.
Wazza77 writes...As mentioned is this something the techs can do at service? My car isn't even built yetAsk for it to be set at PD (Pre Delivery). A lot of other features can be set/changed as well, most via the audio screen. However remote windows and others can only be set via Techstream.Go here to view the owners manual, towards the end there is a section called Customisation which lists all the available adjustments.
PinzVidz writes...Ask for it to be set at PD (Pre Delivery).Thansk mate, will do. Any other tech bits you think are worth getting sorted before delivery?I assume you are ( or were ) in the carsales game from a few of your posts? Seem to have a good idea re this RAV4 . Have you in your travels heard or been mentioned if others have thought the cabin noise was excessive due to any reason? motor, wind, road noise?. Cheers mate.
Wazza77 writes...Any other tech bits you think are worth getting sorted before delivery?Set the auto indicators to 5 flashes, I find 3 is not enough for lane changes. Not sure what variant you've ordered, but if it's a Cruiser/Edge, another option to set is the power back door beeper whilst the door is opening/closing, which can be muted.I assume you are ( or were ) in the carsales game from a few of your posts?Yes, I used to work for various Toyota dealerships for many years.Have you in your travels heard or been mentioned if others have thought the cabin noise was excessive due to any reason?I don't think the cabin noise is excessive, wind noise a bit at high speed. I have the JBL system pumping most of the time anyway. :D

Speaking with dealer today it���s at least 7 months wait, if not longer up to 9 months which I feel is too long to wait. Set on getting an SUV no so looking at the Tiguan again. Anyone else look at the Tiguan 162TSI? Wanting something with a bit of power.

Same here.Love my Hybrid Cruiser AWD.
Any idea how NVH compares between this and the previous gen Mazda3I ask because missus complains about road noise a bit with mazda.I actually saw one of these in the flesh so to speak yesterday and it looked better than I expected.What's the going price for the cruiser hybrid awd in QLD?Edit: never mind at $50K I'll pass.  For that money the interior quality ought to be much better.  (Look at the new Mazda 3 as an example of what can be done in a car in that segment)

Surprised to see the RAV4 being delivered on a very narrow back road in Montenegro.  Kudos to the truck driver.https://imgur.com/MO2L04B
You can easily get a cruiser at $45k drive away...Closer to 40 k mate drive away for the cruiser. Seems like a great buy specs wise and as a whole. Compared to a few others I looked ati should have mentioned for the 2litre 2wd petrol version. In this note what prices have people gotten / been getting fort the cruiser 2wd petrol , in a non white colour ( meaning premium for paint ) ? And freebies thrown in ?

Thought so, I���m going to place an order. Been told 7 months wait, if not longer.
Wrrr writes...The car is a beaut ain���t it? I have the AWD Cruiser pearl with beige interior ��� looks like a dream and drives like one too!!What price did you get it at? I want to get the same
Exciting? I didn't say that but the interior finish  make it a nicer place to be in my opinion.Also seems to have some driver assist features across the range that are only available in the RAV at a significantly higher price.  But I know comparing an SUV with a sedan isn't a fair comparison price wise.For me it just comes down to I'm not prepared to spend $50K on a new car, as it's for my missus and she  can't see the value in it.Obviously plenty of people are enthused by the RAV though, I'm amazed at the waiting period people will tolerate for this particular  Japanese car.  Someone ordering an Aston with interior materials, detail, finish and paint etc to their unique specifications can get it delivered in a year.  Toyota really has no excuse.

VladTepes writes...it just comes down to I'm not prepared to spend $50K on a new car, as it's for my missus and she  can't see the value in it.For me I calculate there���s a 2000-3000 saving per year the rav4 has over my current car. This includes savings in fuel, insurance and servicing. Over an ownership period of 7 years this���ll pay for the changeover plus I���ll be ahead with the residual value of the vehicle. So saving money is one reason people get this car.The product is compelling because I can���t remember the last time the ���performance��� model was hybrid. From standstill the instant torque from the electric engine makes the car ���feel��� pretty quick.Finally this is the best selling vehicle in the US (excluding trucks). This SUV outsells all of Mazda in the US. While you should take car reviews with a grain of salt, the market rarely lies.

I'm sorry to ask this again, but I wasn't sure anyone answered this last time:If you've ordered a RAV4 (or indeed any Toyota that's effectively a Build-To-Order from the Japan factory),and if you've been given access to the Order Tracking System, then how long before your build did the "Planned Production Month" field get populated?I'm now within the delivery month my Dealer has promised for the last 10 weeks for my 2WD Cruiser Hybrid, and the field indicating when the car will be built is still blank.If anyone can share their experience with the Order Tracking System, I'd be grateful.
I���ve been told from order it���s at least 7 months wait due to current delays.
So the 2 tone paint schemes I see on US cars. Is this an option we are likely to see in Aus eventually?

I know they look snazzy but you don���t want a black roof in Aussie sun. I have not seen or read any plans to have the two tone scheme but it might be an option in future.I asked my dealer and he said Toyota Australia this year decided to not do the two tons because it introduces too many options available and makes things complicated for them.
Yeah i understand why they would not need to offer 2 tone paint options at this stage given the  cars demand. I do however love the white roof on the Edge variant in that safari colour or Silver with a black roof on the Cruiser.

Hi PinzVidz. Just dropped the car at the dealership (Guildford NSW) and asked for the Techstream changes as you suggested. The tech I spoke to had no idea what I was talking about. I even referred him to the appropriate pages in the owners manual and his answer is that ���this is only for Japanese cars.��� While he knows about the intermittent indicators, had no idea about the automatic window and sunroof opener. Disappointing that they would not know what is possible with these cars. Might have to escalate to the manager again.
BigMick63 writes...���this is only for Japanese cars.���LOL ��� which is where the cars for Australia come from..Find a better equipped dealer.  Glad the dealership I went to (Vic) was all over it.
Yes. Although this is not over yet. Waiting for the sales office to open to see if I can speak to the dealer principal. If that also fails, Toyota Oz will hear from me. There is one other dealer down the road where I will head to after leaving here if they cannot do these changes here. One wonders how these guys keep their jobs. All they try and do is fob you around.
Can anyone share what they have paid for an AWD Hybrid Cruiser ?Seems to be a lot of people waiting months ��� is that for custom builds with specific options, or are there very few dealer/demo models around as well ?
Regarding wait times, I am at Guildford Toyota in NSW and they have at least one blue GXL 2WD hybrid for sale. Sticker price $42.5k. Available now. Other dealerships may have some as well. I suggest ringing around.
$49500, Hybrid Cruiser AWD, crystal pearl with towbar, front windows tinted & rubber mats all round.Ordered on 28th Sept, delivery was listed as late June 2020, got a call Monday to tell me a December build, January delivery.This is in Melbourne.
I'm curious about this as I 've been through the online owners manual and it lists all the customisations possible.I've marked up the dealer only ones, so I can get them done pre-delivery, but haven't told the dealer, waiting on confirmed delivery for that (Jan 2020).The dealer I'm using must know about them, as I noticed the car I test drove had some set away from the default.
I think most of them know. The tech guy I spoke to had no idea but the guy doing the hands on work knew exactly what I had asked for and dit it very quickly. All good now.

Re auto folding mirrors. I am talking two RedTek in Toowoomba about getting the module for the RAV4.Toyota has changed the plugs he is trying to source them. Had them in my Fords. The good thing about them the fold in on lock and fold out on engine on.

Sept new car sales out today show sales of the new RAV4 plummeting presumably due to the wait times.RAV4 dropped to 11th place (1716 sales) in Sept down from 5th place (2006 sales) in August and fourth place (2419) in August.

There is a trade in, no finance. No idea why the delivery date changed.One dealer I spoke to said 12 months delivery & no discount.The one I bought from said 9 to 12 months and was prepared to deal as soon as we spoke price.

Anyone heard if wc and aa available yet
Was at dealership yesterday and still no apple car play or AA.
Thank you. Was hoping it was so they could upgrade my car with it on the day I pick it up.
The built 2020 ones will come with apple car play standard
Did anyone purchase the GX or GXL models with CVT? I m looking to buy either model in the next 2 weeks and wonder what's the lowest possible price. :)
Took my car in to service today and they said CarPlay for corolla is out but the one for RAV4 they had to put a hold on it until some glitches are sorted out. They said next month.
We are near the border NSW/Queensland and we called or visited all The dealers within 30Km to locate a Rav4 Hybrid 2wd or to do a deal and order one.  What a pain, we have a trade and it created a monster for each dealer in various ways.   One did not want to give a trade value but wanted us to place a downpayment to order a Rav anyway, one under valued our trade and over priced the Rav and wanted a 500. deposit to order on which they claimed would come in 6-9 months.  Finally we found a dealer who was fair about the whole process (gave us a decent estimated value of our trade and a fair price for the Rav ��� {drive away 43,700.00}  but he claimed it would be over a year wait and he wanted 1000. down and we went for it.  But within 3 days we got cold feet not knowing the exact price we were going to get for our trade in a years time, not caring for them holding our 1000 for a year and having to wait over a year so we asked to end the contract.  Dealer said car had been ordered but we would get our deposit back ending the contract.  I asked him to keep us in mind when the car does come in as we were still interested.Boy I hope that by Jan they have RAV4's available and or a shorter waiting time if we have to order one again.We are sold on getting a Hybrid and I love the look and size of the RAV4, been eyeing it since 1999.
Spoke to my dealer yesterday, I ordered a petrol AWD at start of September, they're waiting to hear back on a production match on the 15th (Supposedly when they find out) for a November build and if accepted delivery between Dec 16 and Jan 12.With the backlog on ordering and the global battery shortage currently I don't think you're likely to see a Hybrid Rav in the first few months of the year if you're picky about spec. Your best bet is to call around in other states to find a spec you like and accept you probably won't get any optional extras or the colour you want.Otherwise you're in for a wait.
Agree with you scarecrow. Guildford Toyota in NSW has at least one GXL hybrid blue ready to go. And I was told they are getting more in. Apparently has got to do with the fact they are part of the Sutton���s group which has a big network of dealerships and this a higher pool to pick vehicles from. Worth calling around to see what is in stock. You never know.
I am interested in the cruiser as well, just wondering what other accessories did the dealer threw in for the car?

I���m waiting for my cruiser , about 3 ��� 4 months apparently ?
Actually looking at their site they have a GXL pearl white AWD HYBRID in stock as well.  NORTHERN nsw. But can���t be positive as I haven���t seen it.

I was told there's none with a pano roof left in Australia (I'm a sucker for sunroofs and hate the standard one).
scarecrow398 writes...Aye, a edge in BlueYeah mate but not the panoramic sunroof. Just the normal one.On a side not how much extra is the panoramic sunroof ? Should be a standard on the edge for its price
Anyone able to share price on GX petrol that they���ve obtained? RRP is ~$36k. Keen to know how much people have been able to negotiate.
On a side not how much extra is the panoramic sunroof ? Should be a standard on the edge for its priceThe quote I've got lists it at $1300 which seems fair given the manual cover is replaced with a electric shade, second piece of glass that retracts over the top of the second, new supports, engineering, etc.The driveway quote I got was $50,500 including the sunroof and premium paint. Iirc the original drive away without any options was 53k rrp.
scarecrow398 writes...The quote I've got lists it at $1300 which seemsFair enough. I realise there is a bit involved.Spose what I meant as in it could be standard in edge is it���s quite a price jump from cruiser to edge. I realise it���s 2.5L AWD  and a few other differences but 10k is a big jump.  Not saying there is not value in it. Mind you you lose the 2 person memory preset which is why I���m going for the cruiser.  Why would they leave this out ?If the edge at the local dealer had panoramic sunroof and memeroy seats and I could twist their arm I may have gone up to it. But it���s a big leap.
Not too dissimilar to the above, I was quoted $49.0k DA for the edge. There���s 3 in stock coming this month but there is also a price rise in Nov (+$350 according to the sales guy).However reading up on the disconnecting diff knock/moo noise and lurching issues on the 2.5 AWD, I���m going to get on the waiting line for a less problem prone (for now) hybrid. Plus the Edge doesn���t come in a lighter colour (aka white or light silver) and when I owned a Gen 2 RAV4 in gunmetal grey, I hated myself looking at the grime built up on it.
What did you pay for your cruiser hybrid 2wd drive away and what extras?
$46150 Cruiser AWD in crystal pearl. Zero add on. Not even mats.
However reading up on the disconnecting diff knock/moo noise and lurching issues on the 2.5 AWDWhat issues are those? Haven't read about them myself.
I test drove one of the cloth seat spec AWD hybrids today.I���m not lead footed at all, but the petrol seemed to kick in pretty early from a gentle standing start. It was also noisier than expected (eg compared to the Mazda) when intentionally accelerating hard.The dash also seems a bit cheap for a $50k car (having just looked at the Mazda CX, Hyundai Santa Fe and Kia Sorento)On the plus side, space and visibility were good
scarecrow398 writes...What issues are those? Haven't read about them myselfRav4world has several complaints of them both with some  YouTube vids where the moo noise from what appears to be from the connecting/disconnecting of the rear prop shaft.
Anyone able to share price on GX petrol  i bought graphite gx petrol for 33700 including mats and full tank. This was from Cornes Toyota in Adelaide.

Ended up getting a deal on a 2L petrol 2WD Rav4 2019 GXL demo model for $34990 with a 7 year warranty (5 years plus and extra 2 if you service with Toyota), first year free servicing, full tank of fuel and they threw in a rubber floor mat set and one for the boot.

Wrrr writes...Took my Hybrid Cruiser AWD in for complimentary checkup.Just wondering did they mention anything about ACP or AA
The finance guy where I got this said they had one of the only hybrid models left in Australia. He said the demand has been crazy.
Be good if there was some form of database as to what people have paid. I know it���s been mentioned but what have people seen / gotten the 2wd petrol cruiser in a premium colour for ? Freebies or extras in a bundle ? Cheers Been through the thread a bit but an update would be good.
Wrrr writes...I am hoping to change my own oil and oil filter at 1600km ��� can I obtain oil filter and oil from my dealership spare parts department without them looking at me in a sus way and asking too many questions?Not trying to stop you from wanting to do your own oil change as I have been where you are in that regard but I have since changed my mind about doing them when "the car is under warranty"I believe that most warranty guides say that these sorts of jobs need to be done by a "qualified mechanic". Now while I and many others would be able to do an oil and filter change I'm not sure that putting myself in a position of "warranty refusal" if something went wrong is worth the hassle because of not having the qualificationsEspecially in your case where you want to do it at 1600 klms when the manufacturer is I would guess 12 months or ? klmsI have decided to follow the manufacturers guidelines for service (no matter what manufacturer) at least during the warranty period
Anyone else had any experience buying oil and filter from dealership? What was your experience like?
Buy the filter on eBay from a dealer that sells it. Plenty of Toyota dealers using eBay as their ecommerce platform. As for oils, get that from anywhere. Supercheap etc.
Good idea. Will try to find a Toyota dealer that can sell an oil filter through eBay. The oil is pretty hard to find but not impossible.

More than 3,000km, that's why they threw in the first years free servicing and are also including transfer, rego and 3rd party fees. There was another GXL with much less km's for the same price but we preferred the colour on ours.
For most test drives, people want to test how hard the car can accelerate and pull forward, rev the engine hard and put it under full load, swing it around corners and to pull to a stop to test breaking This is exactly what the manual cautions against during the breaking in period.You���d hope the discounts on a demo accounts for all this. Engine and driveline longevity is my concern.
I reckon people drive demos better than their own cars, new, unfamiliar car that doesn���t belong to you with $3,000 excess.
In my case the car already had rubbers floor and boot mats, tinting and wind shields installed. The car was being used by someone on staff that lived a while away as the high km's on a car only registered just over 4 months. Also it is still a 2019 model with a 7 year warranty + unlimited km's. I don't think it is in their best interest to sell me a lemon as I will just give it straight back to them to fix, for free and cause them a lot of work (it was a Toyota dealer).Regardless the discount and all the extras they threw in made it worthwhile so that would also be another buying factor on a heavily used "demo".
For those who purchased the Cruiser Hybrid AWD have you asked for an estimated delivery date in the contract?I'm reviewing my contract and the salesperson hasn't put in an estimate delivery date.Appreciate that it'll be a few months.. buy surely no more than 1 year?
For those who purchased the Cruiser Hybrid AWD have you asked for an estimated delivery date in the contract?Toyota are all over the shop. I ordered my 2WD Cruiser Hybrid in late July. Up until I literally signed, the dealer (Sydney based), verbally was "three months". Suddenly, the hastily written ETA on the contract I was presented with said Christmas.Later, I asked for an electronic copy of the sale contract, and the ETA had been adjusted to 31st October, with a mid-Oct build. Progress!, or so I thought.After hearing here and elsewhere about extensive Hybrid delays, it took pushing from me to get the dealer to grudgingly admit it was now "mid November build, delivery December".No sooner had he written that, he added ���Toyota are unable to supply any Toyota dealers ETA���s on these vehicles���, which makes me wonder what basis he has for his revised ETA. Sounds like BS to me.The icing on the cake is that 11 weeks after ordering, there is still zero information on the  Toyota Customer Order Tracking Portal. I mean, that website has one job...As I've said before, Toyota are doing a horrible job of keeping their dealers and customers informed.I can't be cranky about the delay on a new and popular vehicle.I am now very cranky about being given inaccurate information about the delay.You'd think that three months after ordering a car, Toyota could give you an accurate idea of when your car will be built.This does not bode well. I wouldn't be surprised if this made its way into the media.John Cadogan, grist for your mill?

Ended up ordering a Cruiser AWD Hybrid in Silver Sky Saturday for $47123 in SA including carpet car mats, have been quoted 10-12 month wait time and already had that expectation.Now just undecided whether $1100 for BlackVue 2ch is worth it, considering done from the dealer won't void any electrical warranty seems a fair price.
bL@De writes...have been quoted 10-12 month wait timeWow.

I suspect something better will turn up by then anyway
True. The plug in version might be out by this time next year or at least in the pipeline for 2021. That���s what I would be waiting for if I didn���t already have one.

Thanks just annoyed that now I have to go into work to get my payslips as they don���t send them to us and nothing has changed with work or my pay.  That���s what���s annoying me the most you take leave to get away from work for a while but now I have to go in on my break

Shop around, you won't void your warranty.Actually doesn't seem too badly priced through the dealer, $938 installed elsewhere, for the convenience of having it installed pre-delivery isn't such a bad thing.I figure if you were playing with electricals it would potentially cause issues although that is if it were proven.mmcr writes...Wow. I was told order now and expect delivery in Jan by one dealer here in Syd but I suspect that was BS and would be pushed back slowly to the 8-10 months everyone else was quoting.In all honestly I don't think they have a clue, when I rang yesterday they indicated it might be only 6 months either way I am banking on up to 10-12 months.
I'm having the same question. Currently leaning toward 2wdI���ve gone with the 2WD, for the driving I do as a daily driver it should be plenty
DIn all honestly I don't think they have a clue, when I rang yesterday they indicated it might be only 6 months either way I am banking on up to 10-12 months.I spoke with my dealer this morning and they said at the start of Nov they will get confirmation from Toyota Japan on the manufacture date. Once this is known they will be able to advise how long it will take. I put my order in last week and the contract says Mar 2020 delivery.
Hi all. I've just been told by my dealer that there is a price rise coming in November. Trying to check with him for a full confirmation, but does anyone know if this would impact me? I had an order placed back in May.Edit: just been told that we would either have to cop the price rise or rescind the contract. Not sure on the extra cost yet
Vincent26 writes...but does anyone know if this would impact me?You've got a signed contract ��� what does it say? Dealer may be able to pass on the increase and you then have the right to rescind if they cannot deliver at contracted price. But check your contract.
Vincent26 writes...does anyone know if this would impact me?No, it won't.  A contract is a contract.If you cancel due to the wait times and then re-negotiate, if a price rise is happening you would be dealing with the new price.Haven't seen or heard of a price rise though.....  Any other sources?

@abr126 , AWD in my case, purely because of the higher tow rating.

Vyviel writes...That's why I got the base model. Made no financial sense to get anything higher lolYou sir did made the financial move. I priced these cars in my previous life and there���s definitely a premium on higher grades. What typically happens is the base model is cheaper to get the headline ���from��� pricing to get buyers in the door to even consider going to the dealership.Interestingly looking at the NZ pricing, the Edge/Adventure about the same as the Cruiser hybrid with the pano roof standard. So it all comes down to the pricing person negotiating with Japan. Clearly notes weren���t swapped between the people across the ditch.
Someone told me if we went novated lease there would be a good chance the leasing company would secure the Rav4 much quicker than private buyers. Is there any merit in this theory?
Hybrid cruiser ordered start of June now delayed until at least December. Was originally set for delivery in Sept and each month I have to ask the dealer what's happening only for it to be delayed another month. Dealing with Toyota has been a pretty horrid experience.
If only they incorporate it as part of their app, it���d help on the customer experience. Post my order going in, you���d think at least to add the car in the app with an order number in it however since the contract was signed, no communications at all except a hard copy of the contract. Though hoping there���s a tech change and I pick mine up with the tech changes.
something to note is after delivery / pick up a survey ��� feedback from Toyota head office is sent and the dealers will persist on giving them a good rating. Well I know the dealer I dealt with did.I wasnt in the same boat as many on here, regarding delay changes..Just thought this information may be handy to know ��� I'm not saying you can use it as leverage or anything of the like...but its interesting how they will expect anyone to give them good feedback / ratings ��� when they dont seem to be divulging information or updating frequently ��� im sure even if they dont have actual updates, a call to assure the customer its still in progress would be appreciated
acacer writes...a call to assure the customer its still in progress would be appreciatedThis!  How bloody hard is this!?I only managed to secure the one I did after not hearing anything for a month and absolutely cracking it with the dealer principal.Didn't get the survey, but really wish I did.   Just as well the car is absolutely brilliant and makes you forget about the garbage service you get after signing a deal.
I got hassled about the survey too when I picked up my car, they seemed somewhat nervous about it...Ironically it's been some months now and I've still not received said 'survey' yet
I ordered my AWD Hybrid Cruiser on 1 June, Checked the Toyota Customer Order Website today and there is, at last, an indicated production month of November 2019. If the stars align right, that should mean delivery around Christmas.It is nice that there is a lot of demand for the vehicle, but doesn't the wait drag on a bit!?
Toyota Customer Order WebsiteHow does one get access to the site? Does a VIN need to be provided first?
I'm glad i didn't have to wait long to pick up my Rav4. But hearing these long waiting.. Is the new Rav4 worth to wait 6 months  for or maybe longer?What happens to those that got the loan?Also has anyone placed Dash cam on their new Rav4?How much for installation?

Hey all. Wanted to ask if anyone got the weathershields, and is using them. Are they uv resistant and tinted at all?
My Edge has started to develop an annoying clicking-type rattle in the gearshift area. Just had it all apart and determined it's coming from the drive mode switch assembly. Will take it in to request replacement under warranty of the switch assembly.Also found this thread on RAV4 World and it seems to be a common problem. Although the last poster has mentioned the trim around the wireless charger causing the problem.
PinzVidz writes...clicking-type rattle in the gearshift areai was wondering what that is..Sometimes in the morning i can hear static type sound but i couldnt tell what it was.  Comes and goes
In the RAV4 World thread I linked, there's a couple of YT videos with the exact same sound. I've since noticed if I apply a little pressure (pushing forward) to the silver trim at the base of the gearshift, it shuts it up.edit: Fixed it. Wasn't the drive mode switch assembly, rather just a simple fix that will take a few minutes;Pull down gearshift boot. Remove retainer clip (U shape) from bottom of gearshift handle, pull gearshift handle up and off the lever. Pull up and remove gearshift/drive mode surround trim, disconnect plugs. Pull up and remove wireless charger, disconnect plugs. Remove 10mm head bolt nearest cup holders. Pull up silver trim surround and pull back to remove.The hole where the 10mm head bolt secures the silver trim is already elongated, but needs elongating further towards the cup holders. Grab a round file and carefully increase the elongation by about 5mm. Refit the trim and apply pressure pushing towards the front of the vehicle while tightening the 10mm head bolt. Refit everything else in reverse order.
Out of interest anyone ordered the 2wd petrol cruiser recently and been given an idea on time for build and delivery ? Cheers.
I got the weather shields thrown in as part of the deal. I use them in that it allows me to slightly crank open the windows when it���s raining without any rain coming in. They are slightly tinted but can���t comment on whether they are UV proof. The good thing is that they are not noisy yet they are not as wide as the old school ones either. I like them.
The local one is not injection molded though made in Australia so they aren���t as good as the ones made even China which are injection molded. The difference comes especially when you run your fingers down the edges. The local have a sharp edge and don���t contour as well as the overseas ones.
Picked up our GXL AWD hybrid yesterday. Very happy so far and kids loving the extra space along the back seat. We happened to find one in stock two weeks ago near us and got very lucky as it was exactly the spec we were planning to order. Being such a popular car there was no movement from RRP but we did get a little extra on our trade in to help us feel better..
BigMick63 writes...They are slightly tinted but can���t comment on whether they are UV proof.Thanks for the review!
hi all,does aussie hydrid rav 4 are suffering from fuel tank issues similar to the USA ones that were highlighted in rav4world?thanks
I don���t have a problem getting the tank full.
Neither do I. For all cars I pull the nozzle slightly out and then throttle the last litre or so into it. Most Japanese cars are like this so I assume it is normal. I can choose to have the nozzle fully in the car and try to fill like this but end up having the nozzle on auto shutoff clicking away a lot.I would think this is normal Japanese car quirk and very normal to me.
I don't think it is peculiar to Japanese cars as I have the same problem in my Mercedes. I think that it may have more to do with the pump than the tank.
Its been close to 3 months for my new petrol gx rav4. Its producing creaking/clunking noise when steering either way when brakes applied. Also subtle creaking noise when changing gear to drive mode or reverse.Similar to this video https://youtu.be/LV29cvIFdYkThe dealer said they couldn't find anything wrong.Is anyone else experiencing the same issue?
softkun123 writes...Is anyone else experiencing the same issue?is it similar to thishttps://www.rav4world.com/threads/noise-coming-from-the-shift-knob-area.297435/
I don't think it is peculiar to Japanese cars as I have the same problem in my Mercedes. I think that it may have more to do with the pump than the tankThere isn���t any issues with the tank for the hybrids in Australia.What I was trying to say is that the throat design of the car limits the flow into the tank causing some backing up of flow during the fill causing the autoshutoff sensor in the nozzle to switch off with clicks.Again the the throat design may be similar in European cars too. While so, they seem to be ok. Something in the design for cars in the US may be restricting flow in the throat. Either this or maybe the nozzles are different in the US and may not be as compatible as ours when fitting into the fuel filler throat.
I've made a comment into this around July and took this problem to the service centre after my 1,000 km on with Hybrid AWD Cruiser and they did nothing about it.
["is it similar to thishttps://www.rav4world.com/threads/noise-coming-from-the-shift-knob-area.297435/"]No not this ... Its coming from beneath.The Noise comes in when you are making tight turns like in a parking lot or turning into a side street. from the drivers seat
Just bought  a second new rav4  hybrid cruiser 2wd on the weekend Pearl white for $46700 including tinted windows two accessories plus one free service, didn���t negotiate much as most of the dealer sold out until next year around April , paid $42500 back in June for the black one , ouch

It was certainly a case of early bird catches the worm with the 2019 RAV4, there is no way I would now get the 10% off I did when ordering on the first day of release (11 May I think). I was prepared to risk the new release bugs but figured this was somewhat mitigated because it was an order and therefore by the time it was built (July) the Prod line would have been going for some months. I really do not think Toyota, in their wildest dreams, saw the level of demand coming.
Serious question ��� why sign today with a 10 to 12 month wait, when after that time you could be looking at next year's model offerings?

SmellyTofu writes...Here���s hoping I get the tech change model if it comes within 12 months but I doubt it given I���m in line now.I'm guessing we won't get any changes (other than Android Auto / Car Play) until a MY21 update. Hopefully in a future update we'll see the two tone black roof option, rear view mirror with camera and a head up display in the top models. Also would be nice to get as options a panoramic sunroof and ventilated seats in the Hybrid Cruiser and not just the Edge petrol variant.In my opinion the Hybrid AWD powertrain is superior to the 2.5 petrol in the Edge when it comes to performance and fuel use so it's annoying you have to buy the 2.5 petrol to get the pano sunroof and ventilated seats. These features are available in overseas Hybrid models so it's not like there is a technical or engineering reason not to offer them here in the Hybrid.
Speaking of android auto. Anyone got the upgrade yet?

On the subject of the ventilated seats, I tested the ventilated seats ��� apart from being a glorified vacuum cleaner sucking through holes in the seats I had a feeling i���d enjoy the novelty for a few weeks and then wonder why I need it except to vent my farts before the misus and her friends get into the car. In fact it���s a futile effort because it sucks it though the seats then throws it out into everyone���s faces again lol
Wrrr writes...I tested the ventilated seats ��� apart from being a glorified vacuum cleaner sucking through holes in the seatsThey blow, not suck.
Vented seats are great in summer. Heated seats are adored by women & not so much for men.I just miss HUD and auto fold mirrors. Having lived with HUD for the past 10 years in the Prius and power meter in the HUD, I will have a big adjustment to look away from the line of sight.Auto fold mirror will be a bit of a trial and error job for me given it is standard on all Japanese RAV4 so there isn't a specific aftermarket module you buy online to make it happen. Somehow I'll have to work it out using existing Toyota kits.
They blow, not suck.Even worse!! Everyone will have a face full of fart then lol

Hey guys, I just placed an order for my RAV this week ��� how long before I can use the tracking website? Salesman said that once the build order is complete, Toyota will assign a stock number which will allow for tracking. Is that a few months away (right before the build it) or something you can get at the start? Cheers :)
Finally picked my car up today. Love it already and was told by my salesman that at my first service next month I should be able to have the ac/aa installed then.
Hi all,I am another happy owner of Cruise Hybrid 2WD (crystal pearl, of course :-)Picked her up two weeks ago. So far, so excellent.I have a couple of things to ask:1) Share you thoughts pls about the best location of the front dash cam on the windscreen.The radar cover area in the top middle is pretty big ��� no room there. Would you rather move to the left (away from the driver) and stay at the top of the screen, or go a bit down, but keep it in the centre area? Please also give your reasons, if you can. Thanks.2) I'd like to get a soft copy of Owner's Manual (say in PDF) for beter search, cross-referencing etc . I searched high and low (no luck) and even asked my dealer for it (he said he would task his service dept, but no response so far).Anyone have a soft copy of OM they are prepared to share?Thanks.

OK thanks. Yep. A119 v3 is what I wil be mounting today.Do you use a suction cup or 3M sticky tape holder on the GPS mount that comes with that camera? Are you happy with the location you use? Not too low? Can you easily access the cam if you need to push its emergency record button? The wiring goes up, then left along the top edge of the windscreen?Thanks. PS. I suppose I can always take it off and try a different location if for some reason I don't like that one.
Did you guys fuse tap to power the camera? Is there still a fuse box in the passenger side footwell like most other Toyota vehicles?

I have installed mine similarly to the one shown on that pic, and I can not see it at all behind the rear view mirror, but I am fairly tall. I found that moving the cam to the left/top leads (due to the curvature of the windscreen) to recorded video image shifting to the left (to the kerb). Not a big deal, I guess, but the current location looked better to me overall.Gave it a test run, and generally it is OK, but noticed the obvious artefacts of the glare from the dashboard top reflecting in the windscreen and getting captured in the video recording. That also affected the encoding algorithm and there are the areas on the video of noticeably  poor quality, exactly where the bright spots of glare on the window got superimposed onto the traffic image captured through the windscreen.

Another interesting question here is about the roadside assistance. We are all getting Toyota Warranty Advantage for at least 5years/unlimited km.The T&C of that warranty says that in case of breakdown caused by the part fault on Toyota side, they will cover towing the car to the nearest authorised dealer.Also, the battery can not go flat ��� or that would be the warranty issue too. You can't lock the car keys in either ��� it just won't let you do that. So, it turns out that the roadside assistance is only really needed for the flat tyre, in case for some reason you can not change it yourself.Is there any other value in getting the roadside assistance for our RAV4s 2019?
Finally tracked down a RAV4 with close to the specs we wanted that we can get next week. Apparently someone cancelled their order.We wanted the Cruiser AWD but aren���t in a position to wait months. We���re now getting a GXL AWD.I need to finalise options with the dealer and am unsure about what to do for a dashcam. How is the genuine Toyota one? Otherwise I can get an aftermarket one + install added to the novated lease agreement. Will that affect the car���s warranty though?

And yes, that's due to batteries shortage. The petrol models have nowhere near that of delivery time ��� usually a few weeks. Can neither confirm or disprove the info above ��� just relaying what the dealers told me.

Gurya writes...I wasn���t aware you can get grey leather in a cruiser. No selection for it on Toyota���s website. Only options listed black and nutmeg.What is called black is in fact dark grey. So, according to Toyota, I got black interior, but it is not really black.
digital_silence writes...Also, the battery can not go flat ��� or that would be the warranty issue too.If you're talking about the hybrid, there's 2 batteries;- the HV battery for powering the hybrid system, A/C compressor- an auxiliary 12v battery for powering all the usual stuff in the car (lights, wipers, ECUs etc.).The 12v battery can go flat if the vehicle is left sitting for months and not started.

Apparently, that's not the case.Well, at least you can drive your car our of the garage using HV battery, for easier jump start leads access :-)
Without any charge in the 12V battery, you will not be able to "start" the car in any mode however, the benefit is that the 12V battery can last 8+ years. Mine is still going after 8+ just fine.
digital_silence writes...I was talking about 12V battery, and I honestly thought that HV battery can assist to start the main combustion engine in case 12 goes flat, after which both batteries will be charging. Apparently, that's not the case.The 12v battery is charged by a DC-DC converter (HV battery > converter > 12v battery). It will only charge when the vehicle is running (in READY state).If the 12v battery is flat, the most common way to get the vehicle going is to jump start the 12v battery, using the jump point inside the fuse box under the bonnet. Alternatively the battery can be charged using a deep cycle charger.The HV battery cannot magically provide power if the 12v battery is flat, even if HV battery is still holding a substantial charge. The power from the 12v battery is required to fire up the hybrid system's ECUs, in turn setting the vehicle to READY state.
PinzVidz writes...It will only charge when the vehicle is running (in READY state).There must be a solid reason for this. Otherwise, if 12V batt is flat, but HV batt stil has plenty of charge, why not share the charge between the two, to bring 12V to the state where it can just start the motor once?
Thanks to someone mentioning Motormouth (previously I've used AutoGenie) I managed to negotiate a deal for Cruiser Hybrid AWD, glacier white with black leather and mats for low $45k in Sydney. Still 6 month wait though.I believe stamp duty is slightly cheaper in Victoria so there'd be a little bit more wiggle room down there.
digital_silence writes...The petrol models have nowhere near that of delivery time ��� usually a few weeks.Our petrol 2wd ecletic blue cruiser is a 3-4 month wait ( at this stage).They had one when we looked, was sold before we called back but and had to put one on order.

At least you got mats unlike me plus my price included the $350 increase that's yet to be announced publically. Congrats on a great deal.
Yep .. the mats are worth about the same as the free coffees and cokes at the dealer.

The warning tags on the number plates are a very good idea as the voltages from a battery pack are well over 45v which is about the voltage that kills you. You do not need to be worrying about this as you cut a driver out of a crashed vehicleIn most hybrids and electric cars there are several points where the batteries can be isolated. I found the diagrams for the various Tesla models on line somewhere. I wonder if there is something similar on line for the RAV4
I really fancied the blue but after seeing it on a RAV4 was less enthusiastic than on a colleague's Corolla. It is a pretty colour, though.

I wonder if there is something similar on line for the RAV4Toyota hybrids have electronic circuit breakers at the HV battery. In the event of an accident, they cut automatically. There is also a service plug (orange in colour) which can be pulled to isolate the HV battery.

Anyone use roofracks on your new RAV4 ?The rails are prefitted and we only need cross bars.Toyota wants $330 for the set of their genuine cross bars.Are there really any benefits in using the originals?What other brands/models can be used for the better price/performance?

Did they intentionally misinterpret your question?
baliset writes...Encourage others to weigh in and express their dissatisfaction.At least you got communicated. After my order earlier this month, I've heard zero acknowledgement other than the piece of paper I signed that day that I've ordered a car.  For all I know, I can easily forget that I've purchased a car at all. They at least should acknowledge me as a purchaser even if they can't provide me with an order number.When I test drove the Suzuki Jimny way back in Feb, they were all mad and keen to email me about it. Though they made a mistake that I had purchased one and sent me heaps of comms congratulating me on my "purchase".

$680 is kinda steep. More than what employees were paying for a lease car. $680/mth in employee terms got you roughly a high end Toyota. Plus $680x6 and that���s virtually a trade in car value unless you���re the type that trades in 3-5 year old cars.

Picked up mine yesterday. Ordered early June (GXL hybrid 2WD). I was expecting to wait another 3 or 4 weeks. I called the dealer a couple of times to keep myself updated on the approx deliverly time and they were honest and accurate about everything.
I ordered a Cruiser Hybrid mid July. Promised delivery day was yesterday.Car hasn't been built yet and Order Tracking portal is still blank for build month. So, I went to my (Sydney based) dealer in person and introduced myself to the Dealer Principal. Interesting conversation. Here's what I learned:- Dealer is just as frustrated at the lack of information from Toyota. The ETA in their system has not been updated by HQ for the three and a half months so far I've waited. It's a PR train-wreck.- Says that cars ordered in the same time frame as mine can just randomly "turn up" unexpectedly, but rarely.- Cruiser Hybrids are the worst for waiting. GX / GXL Hybrids only slightly better. Petrol versions much shorter waits.- Dealer had no knowledge of the piloted rental scheme linked earlier in this thread for customers enduring a long wait. Showed him the CarsGuide story. First time he'd seen it.- Says people with genuine orders already in the system will be "protected" from the RAV4 price rise, which will be about $650. I was emphatic, saying I would hold him to that.- His best guess for my car, with a shrug, was "next year". Sheesh.
baliset writes...Petrol versions much shorter waits.Ive seen this mentioned a couple of times. As in a  Much shorter wait for petrol. But Im not sure how short is "much shorter"?We have an at least a 4 month wait for a petrol cruiser at this stage . ( i realise hybrid is donkeys more )How quick/long have people waited for or gotten their  2L petrol cruisers for ??(  weve order ecletic blue 2WD)On a side note my dealer still has an ecletic blue EDGE variant in stock. But without memory seats and with the added costI am not interested in stepping up. IF it had electric memory seats and they were willing to really work on the price i would consider it.
They rise the RAV4 price?What features did they include?
My understanding is that price rises affect those even with orders however the price rise allows the customer to break their contract if they wish to leave. The $650 is a new number and the justification of any rise was due to foreign exchange.

I had my 6 week old Rav hybrid at my local dealership yesterday having the paint touched up, ( accessories fitters drove the plastic number plate cover screws into the paint) I asked if CarPlay could also be installed. 8 hours later they called and said my head unit needs to be replaced as car play won���t install on my unit, they also tried to tell me that there would be a $200 fee.

acacer writes...I wonder if some dealerships already have the required parts in stock.I emailed my sales person and their dealer principle on Friday, straight after receiving the email.  I still haven't heard from either of them.  I rang this morning a little after 9 and 'everyone is busy' and 'they'll call you back'.  Neither happened.  I rang again after lunch and said I wouldn't be leaving another message and was happy to wait to talk to someone.My dealer did not have the parts in stock :-(.  They even seemed a little unsure of the process.  In the end they said they'd order the parts and let me know when they arrived.  Ah ha, sure.Kind of ridiculous that this is even a thing!  Toyota would know exactly how many Rav's would need the update.  Plain common sense says that you would have ordered and have in stock the correct amount of parts and distributed to the dealers based on the sales figures?  Sales figures is all that any dealer goes on and on about, so wouldn't it stand to reason that they'd know exactly how many 'parts kits' they'd need?To top it all off, Toyota Australia advised via email on Friday 1st Nov that the 'Upgrade was now available' and to book it in with your local dealer.  Umm, obviously not.I've said it before, brilliant, beautiful to drive car ��� probably the best new car I've owned but the after sales service is completely and utterly ridiculous, bordering on contempt.
After initially ordering and then cancelling a 2WD GXL in June, I picked up a RAV 4 GXL AWD last week. Found one at a rural dealer 5 hours from my house so pulled the trigger and flew there on Friday. Had a nice drive home to run it in and get to know the vehicle. Vehicle is great, few little niggly things such as not having a map pocket at the back of both front seats (only on passenger seat for some reason) so the kids argued over that but other than that was a decent drive. The main thing is the wife loves it so happy days!
Just a bit more info on the ACP/AA upgrade, some builds will require replacing the microphone/bezel in the overhead console  in addition to the firmware upgrade. When booking vehicle, they'll check via VIN whether parts require ordering or not. I received this info from a workshop foreman at one of the Toyota dealers I used to work at.
Feathers writes...Kind of ridiculous that this is even a thing!  Toyota would know exactly how many Rav's would need the update.  Plain common sense says that you would have ordered and have in stock the correct amount of parts and distributed to the dealers based on the sales figures?Maybe there is only a limited number of parts currently available, and are only sent to the dealers that have ordered parts at the moment? If Toyota waited till there were x thousand parts (equaling the number of RAV 4's), then the availability of the upgrade may have been delayed till after Xmas? Probably better to make the parts available as they are made available rather than wait until the entire inventory of parts have been produced?
This sounds more correct... I daresay there's probably limited numbers and they'd only bother installing it for people who ask for it?Perhaps I'm just being salty though, as i didn't receive any correspondence about this update ��� only found out via this forum...

They tried to claim that they need to see each car before ordering the parts which I said was ludicrous. They are all the same car so they should have a supply of the parts. Full stop. Can someone with more technical knowledge advise on this issue? One would think same car = same parts.At least was able to get them to pick up and drop off the care for the actual install. Although wife not sure we should trust them with the car...Back to the waiting game now.

BigMick63 writes...Can someone with more technical knowledge advise on this issue? One would think same car = same parts.Hey mate. Not sure but I thought id read somewhere it could depend on build date, but they could check that with your VIN number as to what parts , if needed, were needed. Had read earlier it was for the upgraded microphone.Im happy with my delayed build now as this update seems to be turning into a schomozzle. And mine will come pre installed.Not sure id be happy with blokes pulling out and putting in new bits into my brand new car. But differing views on what needs to be done at this stage by the seems. ?
Wazza77 writes...they could check that with your VIN number as to what parts , if needed, were neededThat appears to be all they needed. Spoke to the salesman whom I dealt with to buy the car and he enquired and got back to me. All they should have done is check their own records for the VIN and find out what was required. They were unfortunately incompetent and wasted my time today.
BigMick63 writes...hey were unfortunately incompetent and wasted my time today.On a side note mate, are you enjoying the vehicle?  We have another month or two before we see ours, but am looking forward to it.  First NEW new car to us so should be good. And currently driving a 16 year old car so some massive tech updates for us. Mind you we love our existing VY clubsport so are holding onto it too. Cant bring myself to trade her in.But yeah keen for the new one. Getting the cruiser but in petrol. But still a bit of a wait.
Wazza77 writes...are you enjoying the vehicleYes, absolutely!  Comfortable. Nice to drive, spacious ( two bicycles fit in the back by just dropping back seats) economical, and powerful at the same time. JBL audio very good but built in screen has low resolution and not that good. Done just under 3000 kms so far and still loving it.
BigMick63 writes...Yes, absolutely!  Comfortable. Nice to drive, spaciousCheers mate. Actually just got a message regarding my petrol cruiser not long ago. Ordered in Sept and now a possible January build?People have been saying on here the petrol are quick to get , but Im not sure about that.Ive asked before on here, but to those reading this who else has a petrol cruiser on order? when did you order it , and when do they think you'll have it??They have an edge in the colour I like locally, but want the 2 person electric memory seats for driver. What a stupid thing to leave them out of the top of the line version. If it had them I would prob consider it .
BigMick63 writes...JBL audio very good but built in screen has low resolution and not that goodGood to hear about the audio. Dont mind a half decent sound system. And its funny a few people have mentioned about the low quality screen. Its a wonder its like this in a brand new vehicle.
Hi all, does anyone know how I can contact Toyota Australia directly?  My dealer has just informed me that all builds after November will be 1k extra on the cruiser, but I recall reading somewhere here that they were told 350. Just want to get something official regarding this price rise so I can reply to them regarding it. Thanks
Just booked my car for its first month service. Asked about ac/aa and how long it would take and he said he���d need the car for 1.5 hrs. Will let you know how it goes on Friday.

Vincent26 writes...This is for Cruiser HybridCheers mate. Guess I���ll find out down the track regarding mine.
Called the local dealership service on Monday to book my Cruiser in (made: Aug/2019, picked up: Oct/2019) for 1-month complimentary check and ACP/AA retrofit. Was told that they needed to order bezel/mic. They had the vehicle details (looked it up by its number plate). The lady in service said she would order parts straight away, but couldn't give me an ETA. Said she would call me back when the parts arrive.Called them again today to see how the order is going. Spoke to the same lady, who said that the order was placed, but they don't have any info on ETA, as even Toyota Australia can't provide it. Called Toyota Australia, and after a lot of waiting and one cut off, finally got through to the person, who took my details and said they would txt me the reference # for that job and would escalate the case to the management.SMS never came... :-)Well, will keep knocking that door... what else can I do... :)
Did the bezel look any different? People are saying bezel or faceplate may change

The screen res from the cameras is terrible. I'm sure we get more clarity out of an iPhone 3GS that what they provide.
the best price for GX petrol? I got one in July for 33700 for graphite sat nav with floor mats and full tank.

Hi everyone, I have been following this forum for a number of months and want to provide details of the deal I ended up getting. I went through Motorscout an online broker. I signed a contract for a GXL 2WD Hybrid, no premium paint, Carpet mats and cargo mat for close to $39,500. It was cheap cause Motorscout go through fleet departments not retail. As to the price you actually get, it just depends on the dealer who bids for you request and perhaps whether they want your sale to add to their numbers. Strongly recommend using them, from registering my quote request to signing the contract less than 48hours
Hi all, For GX Hybrid 2WD, GLACIER WHITE, I've been quoted $38726 (ACT). Above the toyota's RRP :) ($38,653). What is the realistic discount I can expect ?Thanks
We have the nutmeg & wife just loves it .Well worth the wait, you definitely wont be disappointed.Don't have young kids to cause any problems with colour,but having said that nutmeg still would have been the choice.We took a gamble with an unseen interior colour when ordered way back in May, much better than I even expected it would look.

Why didn't you go for KIA Cerato then, if it "has the same (?) safety features as the RAV4 with a smashing HD screen", and all this paradise is just for $28K ? The answer is obvious ��� priorities.

Apples with apples, right? :-)All i was saying is that Toyota could do a better screen if they wanted. That���s it!I am pretty sure Toyota engineers are well aware of the HD screens existance. My point is: There must have been a solid reason why they elected not to use it. My guess is: a) cost (it's not just a screen/touchscreen res. All supporting hardware and apps should match the tenfold videodata bandwidth. As an example ��� realtime maps animation will be lagging badly); b) marketing ��� if we had all this in RAV4, who would ever buy Lexus with essentially the same features, but double the price?
WhatThe writes...With a price difference to the manufactuirer measured in tens of dollars if that.  How much do you reckon that premium sound system actually costs.  How much for a better screen.

This is the salary of a good engineering team.
Hopefully the first update refresh, when it happens, should include two person memory seats and higher resolution screen, at least in the Edge.Are you listening Toyota?
WarrenK writes...should include two person memory seatsTell me about it. ! I���ve banged on about it a few times in here. But if the edge had memory seats I���d likely buy the one that is sitting in my local dealer and had been for months. Same colour as I like as well.  BUT with me and the other half swapping cars often it���s no good to us. I���m tall and large and she���s little. So much fiddling to do with the seat. Especially with minimal head clearance due to sunroof.
I spoke to the head of servicing at my local dealer in regards to the issue they had with installing Apple CarPlay on my Rav,  apparently Toyota made the decision of including CarPlay/ android auto after production had commenced, therefor earlier production models didn���t include all the required hardware. My GXL hybrid is a 8/19 build so even this must have missed the cut off for the inclusion. Apparently they have to remove the top light/sunglasses console and install a different microphone....also mentioned a possible head unit removal!  I���m a little concerned as I haven���t had good previous experiences with this type of work with dealers. Anyone else had this issue with earlier model Ravs that are trying to upgrade to CarPlay/ android auto?
I was think about upgrading to a android base head unit , with wireless CarPlay compatible

It was there at start of sept when i went to look at the cruiser, and not sure how long it had been there before that. And is still sitting there ( well it was the other day )?Not sure how long they are taking to shift compared to other models. But i would have assumed it would be gone by now.
I am sure you guys both know that Edge does not come in hybrid variant in Australia, only available as AWD (no 2WD option), and also uses 8-speed automatic transmission (as opposed to CVT for all other modifications). Just thought I'd mention this, even though you surely know it.
digital_silence writes...even though you surely know itYeah mate, And obviously running the 2.5 L petrol motor as well.These things plus the AWD arent really a concern for me. Just chasing those memory seats.If it had a pano roof (as standard) that would push me that as well.
Wazza77 writes...Just chasing those memory seats.If it had a pano roof (as standard) that would push me that as well.I can't see any reason why they couldn't have included them, after all the slightly cheaper Camry SL has them plus the pano roof. If the Edge is the top model, there's no reason to skimp out on those?
creamypies writes...If the Edge is the top modelYeh. No idea why the edge missed out on memory seats. Asked a bloke at the dealer and he said maybe it was more orientated at single blokes with cash to burn? and wouldnt need to be changing positions unlike a hubby and wife situation.I realise the edge has AWD and the 2.5 L , and cooled front seats, but to me ( as these things dont worry me ) there is not enough differences to warrant the extra 10 grand. But with memory seats, and pano roof id be swayed.
acacer writes...Toyota Australia took way too long to give the green light ��� considering ACP was available from the get go in North AmericaDoesn't seem that bad seeing as the Toyota Canada/UK members on the RAV forums are complaining that they don't get the upgrade yet, also no retrofit available yet for early NA delivered cars which didn't come with it from factory lol.
Just bad wiring plan that it would have been excluded. Wiring harness can tie or exclude groups of spec.I realise the Edge doesn���t come in hybrid also but to pay $3k more for not a lot of difference didn���t make sense to me. The off-road capabilities would have been nice but would only be required a very small % of the time. 19��� tyres also cost a bomb to replace. AWD hybrid suffice for now.When looking at NZ pricing (incl pano roof as standard), the AU price for the same means it���s poor value (I.e higher premium).

Wazza77 writes...Just chasing those memory seats.Wazza77 writes...But with memory seats, and pano roof id be swayed.My Cruiser has that, but only for the driver seat.  No other model has seat memory.

Finally got the sms from them with the Ref # of my case and the promise to come back to me within 2-3 business days, and that's just to give me an idea on the parts (bezel/mic) ETA.No wonder the car wait is 6-8 months... :-)))
speaking of the Edge model ..The US 2020 RAV4 TRD Off Road looks pretty boldhttps://www.toyotanation.com/showcase/2020-rav4-trd-off-road.45347/Like a cooler looking Adventure / EdgeI Wonder if that or a watered down version will be available here next year
digital_silence writes...My Cruiser has that, but only for the driver seat.  No other model has seat memoryYep. That���s the reason why we are after the cruiser. Me and the other half are both different heights and I need it to easily change between the two of us. Especially with the sunroof loosing head height.
Regarding Apple CarPlay upgrade, I called my dealership service department today and said I have it booked in. The admin person said yes all good bring it in. I said I���m calling to make sure she orders parts ��� she said what parts ��� I said people have been turning only to be told parts are required to be order and asked to come back.She checked and said oh yes you are correct sorry because of the system set up we only find out when you turn up and we log you in the system. She then promptly ordered parts in in time for my booked service.

September built GXL. Booked appointment to get the airplay upgrade for this Saturday. Got a call from the dealer asking to cancel the booking as they don���t have part. Lol.
Does anyone recall what the driveaway price for a NSW Cruiser Hybrid FWD was before the price increase?
I myself tried booking in to get the part/upgrade for Android ��� I got a catch-22, where they couldn't order the part unless the car itself was booked in... but then didn't know when the part would arrive, so it was a gamble.I was the first person to call to book for this, so it took her some time to find the info and parts, had to go talk to the service guys, etc etc. I'm not too fussed though, she was going to give me a call back once they have it all worked out.Following on from a previous post ��� I'm going to see if they pick the car up (or can at least drive me to/from work), as they don't do Saturday's unfortunately. Hoping I can get them to replace my numberplate cover too, absolutely hating having the (old) dealer's advertising strung all over it, I find it looks tacky.On a side note, re:wireless charging in the console: my Android Galaxy S8 was a bit rubbish to charge in there, upgraded to an S10+ ��� being a larger phone (and better tech too, probably) means it makes great contact and charges pretty easy now, even with a magnetic case on
booked / ordered last Friday and still haven't heard back from service departmentSeems like a lot of dealerships don't have any available on-hand, where are these parts being ordered / sourced from ... Japan?You'd think they at least have X amount already in AustraliaOr maybe its all a ploy to buy more time to train / get the procedure rightSuch a disorganised mess
Not sure that the front end would comply with our ADR.
Galloway writes...Not sure that the front end would comply with our ADR.Do you mean in regards to pedestrian safety if they get hit??If so mentioned about the square front end to the dealer.

Re the nutmeg interior, I initially ordered it but both the sales guy and his support rang me to warn it was not a great idea. As it happened, I then got into a Kluger with the same coloured interior, took one look and called the dealer to change to black.

I am after the hybrid gx in base colour white. Spoke to a local dealer on the phone, the sales guy said he can't do a cent discount on the hybrid, not sure if bs but he sounded genuine saying his boss won't let him. Went through a broker and through the same dealers fleet department offered the price of just over 37k. My next attempt will be in person, my aim is to get it in the 35k range.
Just want to get a forum's opinion on the following:In my Cruiser, folding back the power mirrors when parked, can only be done (afaik) when the car is still running. In other words, after I turn off the engine, I can not fold them down by the door button.This is a considerable safety issue imho. I always look at my side rear view mirror (in its normal position) for the incoming traffic in adjacent lane when I am opening the door to get out of the car. And I turn off the engine BEFORE I get out. But now I have to fold down the mirrors BEFORE I  stop the engine, meaning that by the time I open the door, the mirrors are folded down and I can not see the incoming traffic behind me!Anyone else with me on that? Your thoughts? Considerations?I am going to bring this up with Toyota during my complimentary 1 months check/AA retrofit.
On the different subj, I was going by the RAV4 navigation yesterday, and had two bad hiccups, where in one case it guided me into the shopping centre parking instead of the ground road turn, and in the other case, it told me to turn straight into the locked private steel gate (I didn't).Just wondering how we go about maps upgrading ��� I guess, OTA is not an option (or is it?), so need to request the service to load the up-to-date maps?
digital_silence writes...Anyone else with me on that? Your thoughts? Considerations?I dont see the need to fold the mirrors when parked on side of a road. Parking lots yeah.Im only fonding that i forget to fold them out until i use my indicator
digital_silence writes...In my Cruiser, folding back the power mirrors when parked, can only be done (afaik) when the car is still runningIt's a bit weird the way the RAV4 does it. I've had auto folding mirrors in my 2 Lexus's, my BMW and also my Hyundai, and they all work the same way. Turn car off, get out of the car, lock it, and then they auto-fold in, this is the way it should be. Having them auto fold in when the door locks is also a good visual indication that the car is locked. Only having them fold in when the car is running is dumb IMO!
I totally agree.After some searching, I found that apparently UK models have an automatic mirror folding mode which works exactly as you described. I suspect that AU models don't have that ��� I checked for the corresponding menu item in setting as the UK's owners manual suggest, and that menu item is not there. Also, the mirror folding rocker switch in the armrest should be 3-position for folded/auto/unfolded operation, whereas in my Cruiser, that rocker switch only has 2 positions (folded/unfolded).So, it looks like we don't have the Autofolding option.  That'd be fine by me if they gave me an option to fold the mirrors in by the buttonpress, when the engine is not running.
digital_silence writes...suspect that AU models don't have thatDoes anyone think that the wiring is already in place for the AU cars but just not connected? I have read about the three way switch for the UK model and was wondering whether the only difference is the switch? Or would they have also left out the motor and used different wiring?
BigMick63 writes...Does anyone think that the wiring is already in place for the AU cars but just not connected?On a side note and probablyBeen mentioned , but why leave this feature out? It seems to be getting to be a popular feature to self fold, and as we know it���s already possible in this vehicle. I wonder if it���s a cost issue, or something else ? It���s in a lot of new cars these days. Not a big drama for me, but my step dads car has it where you have to press to unfold and it���s bit annoying. In much of our driving we would just leave them out anyway when parked.
BigMick63 writes...Or would they have also left out the motor and used different wiring?Sorry, not sure if I got you right... Which motor would have they left out? Surely, the stepper motors inside the mirrors are there cuz the mirrors move ! :-)   What motor did you refer to?To me, the big question is whether the supply for those steppers comes from the battery voltage (permanent) or from accessories voltage (switched). If it is a former then it seems to be just a firmware change. If it is latter then we may be screwed ��� some rewiring will be required along with reprogramming.
digital_silence writes...some rewiring will be required along with reprogramming.I was thinking they left out the motor that controls the mirrors but as you have rightly pointed out, the motor is there as it is how the mirrors move. Could it be simply then that the wiring is there under the switch but not connected as we do not have the same three way switch that they have in the UK models? Or would Toyota have gone to the extent of having different wiring looms for cars destined to different markets?
rbostock writes...Yes, kind of makes the Qi wireless charger (if you have it) a bit redundant.Unless you put some silicone or something to hold the phone in place. Its crap. I tried different cases, no case, heavier type phone and it just slides out of position. Making the charge  pointless.
Rookie question but would the Android Auto work on bluetooth or would it need to be wired as well? :/
Just FYI: there is a WiFi on/off setting in the console menu. WiFi is disabled by default, but can be enabled. Just under that menu item, there is another item called Miracast ���. I was unable to turn it on, but I understand that currently Miracast is only related to the audio transfer from casting device into RAV4 sound system.Whether the installation of ACP/AA is supposed to enable the full video/audio Miracast transfer capability ��� I don't know. But at least it's good to know that the WiFi hardware is installed and can be turned on in this car.Sekhmet114 writes...Rookie question but would the Android Auto work on bluetooth or would it need to be wired as well? :/Bluetooth bandwidth is not high enough to facilitate the big video data volumes transfer.

TMCA Product planners don't get all worked up over what's option package they select. Destination combo around the world are decided by Japan, not Australia but are influenced by each destination embedded within the Global product planning department lobbying for spec or vehicle to convince them to throw money homologating things for a country (usually they've not set foot on).In my experience, there would be no option to choose to change whether or not power fold option is or isn't available. Things may have changed >5 yrs since I last chose spec for a Toyota so don't hate on the TMCA people for the product.As for fixing the auto fold, if someone who already has a RAV4 can take some photos of the wiring behind the driver's kick panel would give some idea whether or not the existing Toyota aftermarket auto fold kits can be plug and play. I have one in my Prius (no auto button) and works perfectly. Fold when locked, unfold when unlocked whilst retaining the fold button functionality with the car on.

#Tonez writes...Anyone know how long it takes to wait for the parts to come in after calling in to install ACP?I was told 1 to 2 weeksMine is being done tomorrow after the initial stuff by the dealership ��� see my posts previously ��� part was ordered Wednesday last week. Got a call from the dealer this morning offering to pick up the car today, but that was too short notice. They are sending someone to pick up at 7 with a promise to return the car by 11 am.All in all around three working days.
Just got the heads up that all hybrid builds have been pushed back to late 2020 or even late 2021.Will wait a little in hopes of improved news or I'll be looking for another car.
Cheers all ��� sounds like setting up the WIFI would be the way to go; I also tried MiraCast to no avail, think I'll wait till the AndroidAuto is in and give it another go.I had problems with my handpiece sliding around when I had the Galaxy S8 ��� since upgrading to S10+ and putting it in a magnetic case, the problem is mostly solved.. TBH I'm surprised it charges through that case, although as noted it's not super-fast: I have one of those Samsung 'fast charge' car lighter adapters for emergencies.I called regarding update last Thursday, parts arriving tomorrow ��� seems 3 days is also the turnaround here too. Locked in For Friday, booking is for 1hr 15min so doesn't sound too shabby.
I got my dealership service to order the parts for my AA retrofit last Monday. Followed up today, and she told me that she "actually gave the order to the parts department, but they only ordered them on Friday".  How very f@%&*#g nice of them...But she said that there was a delivery today of the parts for the similar job ordered on the 7-th (Thursday). So, 2 to 3 working days for delivery of parts sounds right, and I can probably expect my parts to come in tomorrow or on Wednesday. We shall see.

I got my Apple CarPlay installed today for free. Booked last Thursday and got it fitted this morning. They had to bring the parts in on special courier from the Toyota distribution centre in NSW. I booked the service via the Toyota app and then called in to make sure that they have parts on the day, before actually taking the car in.New faceplate for my screen and new microphone. The text on the face plate had to change to align with the new functions for Apple CarPlay.

Funny you ask. Regarding the new faceplate, there is no difference to the text or the look at all. But it is definitely a new part ��� can tell.

I think that customers frustrated with the RAV4 delays need to get organised and compare notes more.Many well meaning commenters have weighed in detailing the delay they have experienced in getting their RAV4.I've created an online spreadsheet, and I'd like to invite you all to take a moment to enter some (non-identifying) data about 1. When you ordered,2. When you were promised delivery3. What you're now being told about slipped delivery dates, and4.

digital_silence writes...After some searching, I found that apparently UK models have an automatic mirror folding mode which works exactly as you described. I suspect that AU models don't have that ��� I checked for the corresponding menu item in setting as the UK's owners manual suggest, and that menu item is not there.Also, the mirror folding rocker switch in the armrest should be 3-position for folded/auto/unfolded operation, whereas in my Cruiser, that rocker switch only has 2 positions (folded/unfolded).So, it looks like we don't have the Autofolding option.  That'd be fine by me if they gave me an option to fold the mirrors in by the buttonpress, when the engine is not running.Spoke to Toyota Australia today regarding the (lack of) autofolding  mirrors option in RAV4 2019.The first reaction of the Customer Relation guy who answered the phone was: "What? Of course, RAV4 2019 has autofolding mirrors! I used this feature when test driving it!" After my request to refer me to the Owner's Manual page, he asked for a timeout and called me back a couple of hours later with "Yeah! You are absolutely right! RAV4 doesn't have an autofolding mirrors feature!" To my question as to why UK model does have it and AU model doesn't, I got the expected "That's the way it is..."I have asked him to lodge the customer feedback and the request on my behalf for Toyota to re-introduce this feature in the next system upgrade. He said that there will be more chance for Toyota to listen to it, if more people asked for the same thing. So, if you would like to see that autofold in your RAV4 eventually, please call Toyota Australia, and put the same request under your name/rego. That way, we will hopefully reach the critical mass of nagging.Thank you.

For those in WA, Moora Toyota has a Crystal Pearl GXL AWD Hybrid in stock at the moment. Additionally, Boekeman Toyota has an Eclectic Blue GX AWD Demo in stock. Bit of a drive for the metro crowd but can jump the queue if that's what you're after. Couldn't find any Cruisers except those available for test drive only.

18 month wait time is crap. These car orders will be filled by the end of financial year for sure. Sales guys just like to crap on with crazy expectations so you buy different vehicles from them. If they aren't selling the other models the business doesn't get the special comps and nobody is happy. Toyota is the largest manufacturer and will not do a Tesla to everyone now they have fixed the production line. I ordered a Rav 4 the other day and was told anywhere between 3 months to 9 months and I'm sure it will be a late Feb delivery. One sales guy claimed 14 months to me but later admitted they want to try and sell other models.Good luck everyone and for the record AWD Hybrid Cruiser Silver $46200 with mats and nothing else in Melbourne.CheersIntercept

Dynamic radar cruise control I think it isIf so yeah from what I know.When I use the cruise control on my Cruiser (no pun intended) , it definitely accelerates and brakes to keep to the set speed and also keeps the distance to the car in front (you can select between 3 distance settings). I am not sure what exactly it's called but it must be using the radar to implement this.
Thanks wazza. I just checked the RAV4 does have all speed cruise control. Meaning they can follow the car at 0km/h. The car will be able to move to folllow the car in front when stop

Rather there were shortages on 19 inch wheels and they went ahead and built them with the 18inch rims. Too hard to change sequencing or scheduling with assembly and cant stockpile cars while they wait, so just go ahead and deal with it later.

Hi all, Got ACP/AA installed today (Cruiser Hybrid 2WD). Here are the key points that people were asking about:1) I have not noticed any visual changes in the screen bezel or in the light/roof button operating console at the top.I did take the pictures of those areas BEFORE and AFTER the installation, and they look 100% identical. I can upload those pictures if someone gives me a good reason why you need them.2) The ACP/AA operation is supported ONLY via USB cable connection. Wireless operation is NOT supported.3) Experience with Android Auto: I use Android phone with OS version 9 (Pie). To operate Android Auto (further: AA) you have to install the AA application on your phone. Also, it requires Google Play, Google Maps and one other app (I forgot) that should be already installed on your phone. Once I got it configured and connected, I was very unimpressed of how few things it can actually do.  This video is fairly representative of what you get: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDdIe8zEEWMThe screen looks like the one on 3:50 in that video, except I only have: Maps, Play Music, Podcasts and Phone.  That's all !Where is Messenger? Where is a Calendar? Calculator? Where is Youtube? Where are all other applications that I can run on my phone?They called it "screen mirroring software" ???  That's utterly misleading, as it is absolutely nothing like screen mirroring... I expected that I would be able to do on the car screen everything that I can do on my phone's screen, but this is definitely not the case. OK, maybe I have to read the manual linked above and learn how to add the applications to the AA screen, but at this stage I find it being of not much use, except Google navigation, of course.
digital_silence writes...1) I have not noticed any visual changes in the screen bezel or in the light/roof button operating console at the top.The only reason I mentioned the roof console is because I noticed finger print marks on the roof liningother than that I dont think I ever paid attention to notice the microphone area

Android Auto only "mirrors" 5% of my smartphone, with the different "look and feel". To me that is NOT mirroring. Miracast ���  *is* mirroring as you get on the screen exactly what you get on the phone.OK, I have not done my homework properly and so, fell into the trap of appealing marketing terminology. OK, no probs, I will start from square1 regarding AA.

Noticed something strange. In the brochure, the GX and GXL come with black bumpers and grill and the cruiser gets 'premium' ones. Our GXL hybrid came with grey/silver bumpers and grill. Did they change the spec on the GXL's now?
My gx petrol produces some sort of noise when on drive and reverse mode. This happens on 2 occassions. When brakes are slightly released not completely on D or R mode. Also happens when steering to extreme right or left and brakes are applied i.e the car is stationary during parking.I have took the car to dealer but was told the sound is normal and nothing to worry about.Is this normal?I have tried recording the noise here https://sndup.net/4tvb
I have found out today that my 2wd Rav4 petrol cruiser due in 2 weeks is one affected by the incorrect wheels.  Unbelieveable!  I had the choice of accepting the 18" wheels (with $1500 visa card), wait until Jan for a new car or cancel my order altogether.  I can't wait until Jan and I really don't like the 18" wheels so I was in a dilemma.  My dealer suggested using part of my $1500 towards having the rims painted black (so it would look like the hybrid model).  As I just can't wait any longer, I decided to go with the rims being painted black but told them I wasn't paying for it as it is Toyota's error and they agreed.  I'm hoping it's a good decision as I really like the look of the all black wheels and the whole car is white/black anyway, but I wasn't left with a lot of great options so unfortunately not overly impressed with the situation.I paid $42400 for the above car, including crystal pearl colour, window tinting, carpet floor mats, rubber cargo mat and roof racks and now have $1500 coming back to me ��� hopefully it's a happy accident!

By my calcs that would retail between $44.5k or $45k , so a nice $2k saving, plus the $1500 now.
I think you may have got a very good deal, all round.  The lower profile tyres on the 19" wheels are suggested on a few reviews as not being as pleasant to drive as the slightly higher profile ones on 18". Having had poor experience on low profile tyres for some years, especailly on uneven surfaces, I would definitely prefer the outcome that you have achieved.Mind you, I do like the idea of the black painted rims.

Don't think so... Here is the sound file location https://sndup.net/4tvb
No I went direct to a dealer.  I did a lot of research, worked out what I wanted, started ringing dealerships to get their best deal (and yes they hate that) and ended up getting my local dealership to better my best offer.  They weren't totally thrilled but I think because of it was a petrol model rather than hybrid then they were more flexible I suppose.
Thank you for that feedback on the wheels, makes me feel a bit better.I thought I would share my experience for any others who are going to have this happen to them.I think the black rims will look good on my car ��� still have about 2 weeks to wait though!
2wd Hybrid Cruiser. Crystal Pearl, floor mats, Front  window tint, bonnet protector, headlight protectors,  boot liner. 45k Melbourne.
Forgot to mention a couple of things from the complimentary check up & acp/aa retrofit last week:- Service ppl at Toyota confirmed that the side mirrors autofolding is NOT supported in AU model. They again suggested to lodge the official guest feedback directly with Toyota Australia.So, please do so if you would like to see that feature ��� if a lot of us do that we may or may not win, but if we don't do ��� we will loose for sure- Power level on the wireless charger tray is fixed and can not be boosted (that's in response to me asking them to, as it fails to charge my phone in its flip case, which is only a couple of mm thick)
On the different topic. Does anyone use any of the following?1) Seat covers2) Roofrack crossbars3) Boot protector mats (side/bottom)Toyota's own or third party aftermarket? If latter ��� which ones do you use? Where do you buy them? Happy with them? Pros/cons? Observations?Thanks.
easyj writes...,  boot liner.Hi easyj. Is this a standard double-sided flip-over liner (fabrics on one side, plastic on the other) or something on the top of that?Btw, the price for that config looks good. What's the dealer's promise of the delivery time?
Try this link; https://cartrimhome.com/Cargo-Trunk-Mat-Pad-RAV4-2019?search=Rav4&category_id=1049They also have other things
What's a realistic driveaway for the GLX AWD hybrid in Sydney (specifically in the Western Sydney area) ?I'm getting quoted 46500 driveway on the website. Normally I know you can negotiate around 10% off RRP for most cars but with the demand for the RAV4 I'm hear Toyota dealers arent budging much ?Is 42.5K driveaway doable or pushing it ?
digital_silence writes...1) Seat covers2) Roofrack crossbars3) Boot protector mats (side/bottom)Im a big fan of the genuine floor mats and boot liner. Wish i had of got them to throw in some seat covers aswell.I think youll be hard pressed to find anything that fits as well as genuine
42.5 for gxl should be possible. We got a cruiser 2wd hybrid for 44.5 in Syd with a bunch of options around 3 weeks ago.Go back a few pages to see my post.
Hi digital, I used a car broker motorscout. Used them for the first time. Got2 quotes with a fair price difference so it was clear that was going to be the best I could get. Popularity of car has seen prices go up in recent months.  Boot liner on top on standard liner. As just ordered car last month it's to early to say as far as delivery time.  I did ask the question apparently dealer will get back to me next week. Quite frankly what dealers say is not worth the paper it's written on. Toyota global HQ communication with dealers is very ordinary.
We are thinking of putting in an order for a Cruiser awd in the next few weeks. However, considering the long wait times can anyone out there suggest a couple of riders to add to the contract to give us an out in case of say illness (we are not as young as we used to be) dealer stuff up etc.
Menco writes...Im a big fan of the genuine floor mats and boot liner.

But I am particularly interested in one that fits on the top of that and also specifically protects the sides.Btw, does Toyota offer their own seat covers for this car?
easyj writes...Toyota global HQ communication with dealers is very ordinary.True. I'd say, even Toyota global HQ communication with Toyota Australia is poor ��� perhaps because we (Oz) seem to be sitting very low on their delivery priority list.

Hey guys, me again. My car was originally meant to be delivered in Dec but has now been pushed back to a January build so im guessing around feb... Anyone else been given a further delay?
I don���t think Toyota would spend the money to retrofit folding mirrors to existing cars, rather the feedback would be used for additional features in the facelift.
Milano Red writes...I don���t think Toyota would spend the money to retrofit folding mirrors to existing cars, rather the feedback would be used for additional features in the facelift.Mirrors are already folding on RAV4 ��� all necessary hardware (stepper motors, their drivers, looming etc)  is already installed. You can press the special button while the motor is running, and the mirrors will fold. It's just a matter of Toyota to change the firmware to add the option to send the folding signal to the mirrors along with the car locking command. That's literally it.

Yes you do hold the fob near the start button for a couple of seconds that���s what my dealer told me anyway. I am so bleeping pi55ed off some moron decided to smash the rear window of my 3 week old car with a lump of wood on Saturday.

How to turn the speed camera warning volume down ?  They are so loud but I don���t want turn it off

Apparently it just doesn���t get the 5 year warranty as it wasn���t installed at time of purchase. I haven���t decided yet. I know it���s great for insurance but it weirds me out having cameras recording all the time recording convos and stuff.  ( and no, I don���t need a tin foil hat !)
Also side note question ( I asked the dealer and wasn���t to sure , also looked in the online manual ) but with the electric read door , if you by chance open it under a low garage roof , does it have a sensor to stop it from hitting it ?

Cause if the camera isnt good to record the plates. No point in having.
Hey all ��� for the cameras, I believe you can turn the sound recording off (I'd have to verify that via book though). My regret with the Toyota brand one is that it only records the front of car, would have loved something more 360�� or at least front/back.... Although at least the Toyota brand one fits the car decor well.I did get the Android Auto install done yesterday; took 2 hours, while the reception were really great with me I was quite dissapointed to not be given an instruction manual of any kind like the PDF shared previously; nor did a rep sit with me to show me what to do and ensure it was working with my phone.Admittedly I was grumpy after a long day and a longish wait, only to find it wasn't connecting for me. The culprit in this case was the cable I used ��� was a 1m cable used for Samsung fastcharge, for some reason it'd stay connected for 10 seconds then drop.Got home, shorter cable worked great; I highly recommend having Google Maps running with both Traffic and Satellite imagery (although after 20 mins of driving I lost the satellite imaging for some reason, possibly either a bug or poor mobile reception)Other than that, I'm rather annoyed that my Samsung Galaxy S10+ is meant to be compatible for 'Wireless' Android Auto, but so far I've not been able to get it working ��� tried connecting via Wifi but that wasn't the magic bullet for me.... Will have to investigate further. As others have said, having a wired setup makes the wireless charging redundant (and is just a PITA having to plug it in each time).Edit: I've found this gem of a tutorial ��� have enrolled as a Beta tester and enabled dev mode in Android Auto: will keep everyone posted tomorrow how it goes https://www.xda-developers.com/wireless-android-auto-any-android-phone/
#Tonez writes...You'll get used to it and forget the camera being there.No doubt i would, but it seems impersonal to me in the confines of a vehicle to have it all recorded.Buy if sound record can be off I may consider it.On the quality of the camera i am not sure.

I think it stood when closing if something is in the way , but was wondering when opening.I am going to set it to not open all the way as my garage roof is low.1) As you mentioned, you can limit the opening angle from the console menu or by the buttons on the rear door ��� please see the owners manual. One inconvenience here is when you are getting something from the boot and pulling out, you forget that the door is opened lower ��� I already bumped the back of my head twice. Ouch. Hard way to remember. :-)))2) If you are watching the door while it's opening, you can stop it in any mid position by short pressing of the button on the door itself or on the remote. But I would not rely on this as it's just a matter of time before you either forget to look at it while opening, or accidentally press the opening button on the remote control.3) As for the sensor ��� no, it does not have a dedicated proximity sensor, but it senses the resisting effort and stops opening if it's too high ��� you can test this by trying to stop the door with your hand when it's half way open and still moving. Note though that by the time the garage ceiling stops the door, it still can get the scratches and/or dents, depending on how hard/rough the stopping surface is. So, I have limited the max opening for my car already (mind your head! :).

Answered all my questions.Yeah, I had read about stopping it by pressing the button mid opening, but cant trust my kids to do that without it hitting the roof!!And yeh, I thinnk I am  also going to set it to not open all the way, but as you mention ( and I am tall ) I will no doubt knock my head against it. I may just have it to open fully and make sure I or the missus grabs any groceries or such out before putting in the shed.Maybe I can just tape a pool noodle to the roof of my shed for it to stop against !! ( just jokes )Thanks again mate, I had a look in the manual and did a bit of a read, but its great with people who have real experience using it.
The opening of the boot was one of my concerns, so when I did a test drive I parked in my garage and worked out, that if it's parked forwards, the boot will hit the trailing arm on the panellift garage door. Parked in reverse, no issue when fully open.I tested the setting from at 4 and it won't hit, plus I'm not that tall and neither is the rest of the family, so when mine arrives, that's the first edit I'm making.
Wazza77 writes...Ta mate, it actually looks quite easy and practical in regards to use and setup.Appreciate the link, after watching that there is half a chance I will get one i think. And just turn audio off.Looks nice and tidy in the vehicle too.I did a very serious research about the dashcams after I bought my RAV4, and there are millions of discussions around the world on tat subj.As a result of that homework, I have bought one and am very happy with it now. Mounting can be done quite neatly. The only issue (general, regardless of the camera model used) is the glare from the dashboard top on a sunny day, reflected in the windscreen and superimposed onto the camera footage.In a nutshell, that's the cameras I would recommend, unless you have a fancy requirements like wifi or cloud streaming:Single channel camera : VIOFO A119 v3 (must be v3! )Price is around AU$150.Dual channel (two cams: front+back): VIOFO A129 Pro Dual. (Must be PRO! as it has 4K resolution on the front camera) Price is around AU$360.

No matter how high the camera is mounted ��� it's not a direct glare to the lens that causes this issue (that one could be solved by the lens hood). It's the dashboard top glare bounced off the internal surface of the windscreen back to the dashcam.Think of the torch instead of the dashcam mounted the same way and shooting the beam onto the road through the windscreen. Some of that light will be reflecting down from the windscreen and falling onto the dashboard top.With Dashcam it is exactly the same light path, but in reverse direction of light travel.People use the black matte mats (excuse the pun) on the top of the dashboard (yuk!) and/or polarizing filters  ��� both solutions have only limited effect.

CheersSorry guys, no idea about the installation labor cost ��� I did mine myself, and I don't mind the wire exposed in some short parts (I mostly drive around by myself), so that's probably not a good example for you.  Just will give you an idea of what the routing is (I am using the single channel, front only cam): Dashcam is mounted roughly in the middle, around the area where the front radar is. The wire from the cam goes up then to the left, held by the folded up passenger's sun shieldthen drops down along the left arch (I tucked it away to under the airbag cover)then jumps into the shelf in front of the passenger seat (where normally a glove box is)then drops down to the wireless charger area to the USB output there. It's neat enough and does the job to me, but I guess, a professional installation would be beneficial.

Is it worth while to install AA if you've got your phone connected via Bluetooth to the car?  As the sounds and commands come from the car.
namhsirIrishman writes...Is it worth while to install AA if you've got your phone connected via Bluetooth to the car?  As the sounds and commands come from the car.You will keep all sounds and voice commands after the installation of AA. Apart from the obvious benefit of being able to use the Google Maps on your car console screen, I personally didn't find much use of AA. But you may have a different set of preferences.Go back by two or three pages and find my post where I describe the installed AA in my Cruiser. Also see the link in my post on this page to the list of applications compatible with AA. Then it's up to you to decide if you will benefit from getting AA and apps installed. To me, as I said, the Google Maps alone fully justifies the installation.Actually, you can run any app via AA, but this is not legit and requires a root access to your OS. It is essentially a hacking, and I am not going to promote this here. Google it if you're interested.Don't know anything about ACP (Apple Car Play), but from what I have heard, it has much more extended functionality compared to AA.
Wazza77 writes...ALso , what are you going to do regarding the wheel issue? take the 1500 eftpos card?Hey Wazza, Yes the dealer is having the rims painted black (same as the cruiser hybrid) at their cost and I'm taking the $1500 eftpos card from Toyota.  I'm actually pretty happy with the end deal to be honest and think the wheels will look great with the pearl white.  In answer to your other question, maybe my car is arriving faster due to the colour (?).  No idea.And, months ago my dealer had an electric blue Rav4 (didn't last more than a few days) and to be honest it really looked awesome.  My son was trying to encourage me to get that colour once he saw it but I'm too boring with my car colour choices!!  I think you'll be really happy with it!
I have the eclectic blue. Dealer offered me a Pearl white cause my car was taking so long (30/05 came 25/10) I liked it and would have taken it but my family said no want the blue. Love the colour and makes it easy to find in a car park

Didn't think the Hybrid was worth an additional $6000.PS ��� I was given floor mats for the FRONT seats only, none for the back.Not sure if stingy dealership or that's how it works.
easyj writes...Hi Wazza, what fuel economy are you getting?  CheersI am not Wazza, but can tell what I am getting on my Cruiser hybrid 2WD.I have just put a second tank of petrol in on Monday. The dealer fuelled it up first time for me. On that first tank (drove 350km from the country dealer, then normal city cycle thereafter) I had 5.6L/100km calculated (the actual consumption, not an estimate).Considering that the tank capacity is 55L, I would have got almost a thousand km out of full tank (I fuelled it up @ 880 odd kms, when there was still some decent amount of petrol left in the tank).So the rough conservative figures are:5.8L/100km and about 900+ kms from one tank.I keep the car on ECO (green) driving mode setting.
I had my car tinted at dealership and found many tiny air bubbles under the film. The dumb wit who installed the film also butchered the rubber seal around the edges of the triangular glass panel on each door ��� he cut the edges of my rubber seal so he didn���t have to tuck the tint film into the edges.The bubbles are not normal but is the slicing of my rubber edge seal around the triangular glass panels normal?I have asked dealer to rectify and will see what they say. I expect replacement of my factory seals and then tint film replaced. The lazy dumb wit that stuffed up my tint better stay far away from my car.

ozil writes...Didn't think the Hybrid was worth an additional $6000That's because there isn't enough supply of hybrids to meet demand so no discounts.  Hybrid option is only $2500 extra.
Thanks digital. Pretty good for first tank.  Might get slightly better in the coming weeks.
richardJF writes...Hybrid option is only $2500 extraYeah but im assuming the GXL quote was maybe 2wd  ? whereas the quote for an extra 6000 was maybe the AWD hybrid
My milage has been on 6.2L/100k for some time now, my route to/from work is half on freeway, half through country.I take it from eco mode to sports mode when I need to jump on/across the freeway from a stop, that burst is amazing when I need it
Wazza77 writes...Yeah but im assuming the GXL quote was maybe 2wd  ? whereas the quote for an extra 6000 was maybe the AWD hybridNo. Pricing appears to be full.price on hybrids and a decent discount on the 2l petrol models
Sekhmet114 writes...half on freeway, half through country...meaning that you are probably running on the petrol most of the time...
a full tank is bout 940km and about 5.4L/100km. I've been driving for just below 8,000 km since July.
richardJF writes...No.I understand what you're saying. But i think people are still getting discounts on hybrids as well. Maybe not to the extent they were , but still possible. When we ordered end sept discount was the same overall whether we went the hybrid or the petrol for the total sale price of the vehicle.But obvs it varies town to town, sales person to salepersons, and obviously your bargaining prowess.But I understand hybrid is in high demand.

Driving since July too.  If I push, I might get 900ks from a tank, but often fill up when it's either at the bottom of the price cycle or under a quarter tank left.  Probably 70/30 for highway / city kms.Massively noticeable difference in the petrol station fill up frequency.  I've gone from once every 6 days ($80 tank) or so to once every 10 ($65 tank).   Feels extraordinarily cheaper to run from my POV.   Actually looking forward to only paying a fixed service fee.  My previous Jeep was outrageously expensive to service (4 times the price).Haven't had the AA or ACP update yet, my dealer is dragging their shoes.  Was booked in for last Monday for the update, they rang and said they didn't have the parts but would get them in and let me know when they had them....  hmm....
Actually getting 4.8 to 5 from my gxl awd hybrid. Mostly sits on eco mode and probably 70 town 30 highway. A full highway stint will see me at 5 to 5.2.I tend to try keep it in the orange when accelerating and back off quite early when i see a red light.
make sure you have a good lightning cable to go with it. Starting to love the ACP with better sound quality over the Bluetoothand and love using Waze.

Hi there ��� am currently enjoying a Cruiser AWD Hybrid. A few thousand k's in now and drive from Hunter to Sydney ��� so mostly highway and am currently at 5.5 l/100. Electric motors do some assistance even at freeway speeds depending on the grade of the road so even with high % highway, the economy is good.1) also have Apple CP running and is very good ��� appears to work well with the built in driving announcements etc.2) have a query ��� this is my first car that can accept e10 ��� should I use it??? or is it better to use premium, in which case 95 or 98.Hope point 2 isn't a mine field ��� I just am not sure what the general concensus is. thanks,

Thanks digital_science. I have also heard that often the slight $ saving is balanced by the slight increase in consumption with e10 ��� am happy to use 95 with the occasional 98, given the already low fuel consumption overall with the hybrid. Cheers.
It's a shame they not releasing the plugin here.. looks like a super car!

Did anyone have an idea of what's the current good price you can get in Sydney for AWD Hybrids Cruiser Premium Paint? I don't mind the wait time which is around 12 months now I believe.

Wazza77 writes...Is it just me or is it an unprecedented thing to wait near 12 months for a new car.? I mean it���s my first new car I���ve bought and I bought a petrol version and still have a 4-5 month wait.If I remember correctly, the Toyota 86 had a really long wait too when it first came out, not sure if it was 12 months though but it was long enough for people to be on selling near new cars for a profit. I waited approx 4-5 months for my Ford Ranger in 2013, but again, certainly not 12 months.The salesman who I purchased my RAV 4 from said that initially they allegedly had expected to have ~5000 on order within the first month. Toyota supposedly had exhausted that allocation in the first week of release. Apparently a lot of rental fleet buyers have snapped up Hybrid models, with plenty on order.

Even our 95/98 fuels are pretty dirty compared to Europe. Europe's mostly moved to the 95 spec due to this.  E10 emits lower CO2 per kg and has less particulates and sulphur BUT has less energy so you burn more. (Not clear that it helps when you look at it all). I don't know that it's "worse" for an engine other than fuel economy.Some info: https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unleaded-petrol-119462
RAV4 Prime for MY2021 (US Summer 2020) looks mighty:https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/toyotas-first-plug-in-hybrid-rav4-piles-on-the-power-and-fuel-efficiency/39miles (~60km) of range on pure-electric, 302hp (223kw) with 0-60mph of 5.8sec.60km of range is probably about the commute for many people, so an option to do it on all electric and plug in at home would allow you mostly avoid petrol costs. (90MPGe means 144km per 33.7kwh or about 4.3km per kWh or 232wh per km.  My simplistic maths shows that it's not terribly efficient but if your power is cheap or you've got solar and can charge from it then you'll win on running costs. No prices so hard to calculate TCO).

No, you can't force the system to be permanently running with the ICE only.Can someone explain why this is the case (hybrid 2.5L can tow less weight than 2L petrol) ?It's a limitation of the hybrid system's towing ability. The AWD is more capable because of the extra electric motor.You should've bought an AWD hybrid.
We have a September 2019 RAV4 GXL in Australia and with the navigation it does not show how many Km or time to go to end a trip.  I have checked all the options and can not find where to turn it on.It shows the Km and time for journey at the bottom right corner as you finish putting in the details, then goes off.  The version of the navigation is 1 April 2019.Can the navigation show how many Km and time to end a journey, as you are driving?

To the left of that bar, there is a small icon, which looks like a round "recycling" sign ��� two arrows forming the circle. Pressings that icon toggles the trip info indication between the progress bar and the distance/time to destination.I will get the version of my nav tomorrow.Offtopic: consider getting the ACP/AA installed for free and starting to use the proper Google Maps.
Thanks for the reply.  You were correct so that is another thing I have discovered.  I just about find out somethiong new on the Rav4 every day.  :)I'll get ACP when I put it in for the first monthly check.  Then I might have to get a newer phone as IPhone 6 takes a long time to find the GPS.  Apple did something to the IPhone 6 to get you to buy a new one.  My mates IPhone 6 has just started doing it recently also.I usually use WAZE as it shows all police radars on highways, traffic holdups etc etc but not working too good with IPhone 6.  Maps apparently does not need the GPS fix for some reason.Thanks again.

Your maps are probably the last year ones. That's what was in my cruiser anyway, and I wrote few pages back that they got me into the trouble a couple of times (incorrect info). So, during the complimentary check, I insisted and they loaded the latest maps (July 2019) for me. Not that it matters much, as they installed AA and I am using Google Maps now, but you never know.Never used Waze before, and after reading a lot of good reviews, I am going to try it.

Thanks digital_silence.  I'll also get a map upgrade as you mentioned.  The searching on the RTFM will be good.I bought TomTom and they stopped updating it and broiught out a new version so they could make more money.  That is when I found out the new version of TomTom most did not like for some reason and a lot in the motorhome community moved to Waze.Waze has the features I like like any break down on the highway or hold ups etc. I see the RAV4 one does advise of holdups and not sure what else it does yet.  Waze also displays your speed in numbers which I like.  It just takes a bit of getting use to like all new GPS.
Thanks Marlin I'll make sure I get that version.
I am still new to the Rav4 but it appears the brakes do not automatically work unless you have selected that on the steering wheel.When I select it I notice on the highway if the car ahead is going slower than me it applies my brakes when I get too close.Just wondered if nothing is selected on the steering wheel, does the brakes automatically apply if I was going to hit someone in front.  Not that I plan to have an accident.  :)One other thing which may be strange, I was getting off a highway and lane sort of narrow but nothing near the side of the car and the mirrors came in by them self.  I had two hands on the top of the wheel at the time.  I have been down that road again and they never came in.  Just wondered if the mirrors were going to hit something do they come in by themselves.  Probably not.
firepowers writes...I am still new to the Rav4 but it appears the brakes do not automatically work unless you have selected that on the steering wheel.I assume you're referring to the cruise control being set in its default Active Cruise Control mode. AEB is always on regardless of whether cruise is set or not (in either active or dumb mode), unless you disable PCS. If the system detects an imminent collision, it will warn you by indicating "BRAKE" in the cluster along with a warning tone and then apply the brakes if required.firepowers writes...I was getting off a highway and lane sort of narrow but nothing near the side of the car and the mirrors came in by them self.The BSM lights in the mirrors might have lit up due to a false reading if the lane has close metal armco (eg. safety barrier).
Hello all,Anyone that���s gotten the hybrid, how do you find the sound in the cabin when the petrol engine comes on?I test drove it the other day and I noticed that it goes from silent cabin to a thrashing engine sound (only accelerated from 50km to 60km)
logan90 writes...Anyone that���s gotten the hybrid, how do you find the sound in the cabin when the petrol engine comes on?Disappointingly noisy. When I owned a Prius C the engine was as good as silent and it drove like a mini limousine. My Cruiser Hybrid leaves you in no doubt when the engine is running. I did read somewhere that on hybrids they'd omitted soundproofing to save weight, if so rather sad.
Owning a hybrid made me really want to go all electric for a car. The best part of driving it was when it was in electric only mode
Thanks PinzVidz for advising that AEB is on all the time.  I thought it might be but did not know for sure.There was no barriers/guard rails near where the mirrors came in but must see if the grass on the side of the road was long.
logan90 writes...Anyone that���s gotten the hybrid, how do you find the sound in the cabin when the petrol engine comes on?Ive ordered a petrol ( I dont need a hybrid ), and mind you while my test drive in the petrol was still a bit noisier ( engine wise ) then id expected, it was  nothing like the hybrid chugging on and off ! IF i was keen for the hybrid it would have dissappiointed me. Also the hybrid we test dove had an aweful " whine " soudning like it was coming from the electric engine. My missus thought it was  a siren down the road behind us at first, until we realised it was just the car.
DockTony writes...I did read somewhere that on hybrids they'd omitted soundproofing to save weightNot sure how much the petrols have either, because to me it was also surprisingly loud ( petrol 2L). It ll be fine for us around town and we are lucky to take one big trip highway wise per year, so hoping its not going to be a big issue for us ( this is in the petrol cruiser ). Mind you it hasnt been built yet and Im hoping they are making some fixes on the go ! as they learn of issues or complaints.
The hybrid does help significantly with refinement and quietness. The surge of electric torque means the petrol engine does not need to struggle or rev as much
logan90 writes...Anyone that���s gotten the hybrid, how do you find the sound in the cabin when the petrol engine comes on?I test drove it the other day and I noticed that it goes from silent cabin to a thrashing engine sound (only accelerated from 50km to 60km)There are two components in the answer to your question: Objective and Subjective. As to the former (boring): We'd need a proper SPL (sound pressure level) meter and (preferrably) a spectrum analyzer, to gauge the real noise level. I do have one, but am not intending to do the tests that surely Toyota would have already done, as the noise level in a cabin is surely a regulatory compliance matter. In other words, if it didn't pass the formal tests, we wouldn't be driving this car.As to the latter (of your interest): I can definitely tell (by the sound) when the combustion engine kicks in, but neither the level of it nor the perceiving roughness of the sound, bother me a slightest.Speaking exclusively about my personal perception.  I have a Cruiser hybrid 2WD.
I've always wondered something about hybrids ... they are great for frequent short trips, this is where they excel more than highway cruising. However, the question I have, is that with the frequent short trips, the petrol engine may only turn on for only a few mins, with the electric motor doing most of the work. Does the petrol engine get hot enough often enough to heat the oil enough to burn off the condensation as it likely reaches operating temperature far less frequently than a petrol only engine?
creamypies writes...Does the petrol engine get hot enough often enough to heat the oil enough to burn off the condensation as it likely reaches operating temperature far less frequently than a petrol only engine?Unless youre driving less than 35km/h and 2km, then the engine will fire up and get warm pretty quick.
On hybrids the water pump is electric so the engine heats up very quickly. By the time I've driven down six levels of car park ramp my temp gauge is well off the bottom. So much better than my X-Trail diesel which took 2km to move.
Just got an update on my Rav 4 and it's finally coming. Rav 4 Cruiser AWD December build and Jan delivery. Ordered my late July so by the time it arrives it would have been 6 months. Hopefully apple car play already installed.

A bit annoying as it'd have been nice to have for some longer trips during the school holidays, but I guess it'll be 2020 plate car.
Our GLX is a month old and I noticed a small sqeeling noise when I take it from reverse to park.  The brake pedel goes down a little at the same time but that would be normal.I guess no one has the small sqeeling noise when going from reverse to park?

PinzVidzYeah that is right so I guess a small fairly sofy sqeel is OK when putting it into park.  I'll book into the first free service soon so will ask them about it then.
Does anyone who's waiting on the MY20 model to be delivered know if there are any changes to these builds (minor differences) to what the Rav-4 offers now?
If you have the inclination, search for the mechanical details on the engine. A big part of the engine management is around carefully staged temperature management for water and oil. The simple answer is that it gets to operating temperature very fast, but is, overall, a cooler engine to reduce many poor wear characteristics of hotter running engines
Is this part of the MY20 upgrade?
grahampeters writes...A big part of the engine management is around carefully staged temperature management for water and oil.One of the interesting things about the RAV4 is the CVT gearbox. Driving one for the first time when road testing them it was weird ��� electric motor gets it moving and then the petrol cuts in but at a constant RPM due to the CVT gearbox. So I imagine that there's a lot of clever stuff going on to manage the engine. The electric motor fills in the torque gaps in the petrol engine and means a fairly ordinary engine works well.

These are the changes I am aware of coming to those who are waiting on an MY20 model:-Hybrid ��� More sound proofing (under the bonnet and in the cabin).

Ordered a 2wd cruiser hybrid over the weekend. Was told by the dealer ETD 6-12 months, but given a delivery date on the contract of Aug-2020. Is this timeframe similar to others who have placed their orders recently? I saw Toyota Aus say they are expecting delivery times of up to 6 months but in my experience dealers are saying longer wait times.

Someone I know has a Hyundai Iconic and that thing makes a 'whirring' sound that changes based on speed.These frequencies for hybrid cars are supposed to be unique for the specific brand!I guess you'd be pretty smart if you could close your eyes and say 'That's a Toyota' as it goes by.:---()The sound proofing may apply to other models also if they have issues with road noise.

SmellyTofu writes...ust a lower pitch noise than the hybrid high pitch motor noise.Thanks mate. Quite interesting sound and slightly annoying I reckon. But I suppose anything would be but they have to have something. Be interesting to see how noticeable / audible it would be in the cabin. I see in that video it can be turned off but I assume that new holds these days you���d have to have it for legality purposes and wouldn���t have the option.
SLedGE writes...The sound proofing may apply to other models also if they have issues with road noise.In our test in the petrol I Reckon noise was noticeable inside. And I have read and heard about it from others.  Our 16 year old clubsport to me is quieter inside. But On that note it���s a sedan and not a wagon style like the Rav so that would add to road noise. But engine noise was noticeable I reckon. Ours is yet to be built so I will see when I rocks up in a couple of months!
Well I have a new RAV4 petrol and I find it really quiet. Maybe it just comes down to what you are used to.
Here���s some extreme sound deadening (look at the photo of you dont understand Japanese). I don���t agree with the last part but love the effort on the materials.

We only do short commutes really anyway and one long drive a year. It may have just been the one we drove too ? Dunno. But it���s just about to be built so looking forward to it.
Well I got Mine today and it is great, also sound deadening on the hood and to me its quiet.Its a GXL AWD Hybrid ordered end of July, October Build. I notice from the spread sheet  most Seem to be Cruisers. We did not need Moon roof Elect adjustable seat or 7 inch Dash.So real Happy
Great to hear that you have the updated sound deadening.Did you notice it it makes an artificial sound when driven in EV mode?
No doggy Noise at all I Live in WA (and that stands for Wait Awile)
When I connected my S9+ with the head unit through the Toyota App, I could not update the Toyota App Suite. I was able to download the update but the installation stopped at 50% every time.I have tried to restart the car and the phone but could not resolve.Just wondering if anyone has the same issue? Had the Apple Carplay and Android Auto installed yesterday.
rroland writes...also sound deadening on the hood and to me its quiet.Its a GXL AWD Hybrid ordered end of July, October BuildDoes this mean Oct build onwards should have the sound deadening or is this an optional extra that you added? My Car is a December build and it would be great if it was included.
This is such a depressing time line but also very handy! (Sorry I meant to reply to the google sheets)
I thought Australian models always had sound deadening on the hood? Is that what you guys are referring to when you're saying more sound deadening in the 2020 model?
Of course it will be included.I think from October onwards they classify the builds as 'MY20' spec.
Yep
We received our  GXL Hybrid  2WD last week and it has the sound deadening under the hood, it a small black thing which I also have  in my 10 year old Honda  Jazz, however  I  have found the car a more quieter than the one we test drove around the time it was launched.I was surprised to see that it also has puddle lights under the side mirrors, it comes on when it's dark(night time)  on unlocking the car.Apparently in some of the USA model which does not come  the foot lamp and ambient lights in the front cabin as standard , ppls have found the wiring and socket under the steering ready to just plug in the lights ,which you can buy from Toyota dealers as replacement parts. see link belowhttps://www.rav4world.com/threads/footwell-lights.299027/page-3Please flick through all pages on above link for more details..Is this possible on Australian GXL , can any one who owns  GXL confirm ?Thanks
Got my cruiser hybrid this week (ordered first week of June).  Haven't had time to really drive but did notice it is dead silent when on and you're outside the car.I assume this is right but i couldn't force EV mode because the battery wasn't full.  I assume that's just because it's new and the batt hasn't been charged enough yet but would be good to know that's meant to be the case.

A pleasant surprise this evening. Expected delivery date for my AWD Hybrid Cruiser ordered on 1 June,has come forward two weeks. I might have to get my act together to organise some sundry items that I want done to it
What have you got in mind?I want to get the nudge bar and a nice light bar for mine that will fit nicely.Also going to get the dark window weather shields and boot liner along with the factory tow bar.
Anyone know how to turn off the damn warning system for Speed/Redlight cameras? When I'm the freeway it triggers everytime I go under an overpass because there's usually a camera at freeway entrances but the GPS system can't tell which level I'm on.
Was there ever a price rise that happened for the RAV4? There's nothing in the news that has mentioned anything in regards to this.
ozil writes...When I'm the freeway it triggers everytime I go under an overpass because there's usually a camera at freeway entrances but the GPS system can't tell which level I'm on.It's in the settings menu of the console unit, in the safety assist (or similar name) section. You can turn off the notifications for events/things (school zone, going over speed limit, approaching speed cameras, etc) that you don't need.Alternatively, in the Voice settings, you can consider just turning the voice volume down. I think it was set to Level3 by default, and it was way too loud/annoying for me, but I adjusted it down to Level1, and it's now kind of OK.
They sound like sensible improvements but does that apply to USA models or those sourced from Japan?
I had already ordered towbar, mats and cargo mat. I might get a clear vinyl wrap on areas prone to stone chipping.  Also need seat cover for the rear seat (big dog with muddy paws) and maybe Camera.Anyone got great insights on the best DashCams at the present.

Hybrid vs non hybrid?
The general view seems to be strongly in favour of the hybrid, but the waiting time of 6-12 months or even more, might dissuade you. I just visited Nunawading Toyota, which had about eight or ten new RAV4s on the lot, none Hybrids. That delay might get worse with the recent decision by Drive and others to award it Car of the Year for 2020.From commentary in Australia and US forums there seems to be some unease about transmission issues on AWD non-hybrids, with minor grumbles of noises etc. I am not sure whether the gripes are reasonable or legitimate, but the AWD hybrid has no mechanical connection between front and rear axles, relying on a separate electric motor on the rear axle. I have seen no adverse remarks on this arrangement.Whilst the RAV4 is a very competent SUV, it would probably not have outclassed the Subaru Forester (or a couple of others) in my assessment, but for the availability of a good hybrid drive-train. That is probably that major thing that really what sets it apart from other SUVs at present.
Agree with this. I have just  received my new GXL AWD hybrid . Great carordered in July. But to wait . The time   they  say now ! . Not Good. Would Definitely get a Subaru Just My OpinionEarly Days on The Toyota But My Daughters Subaru XY is a smaller version but a great carTech is same ,Fuel  not that much more Service is More But I Got her Free service for 3 years.So depends on You . The  Toyota is Just Cheap and Cheerful . Suits me
The Toyota is cheaper to service and would hold it's value over the Subaru.
Subaru���s have big issues with their boxer engines ��� in their effort to cut fuel consumption they���ve reduced the fit between piston and block to reduce friction and increase economy ��� however this is causing problems with increased oil burn and consumption ��� they haven���t sorted this out yet. Good luck with the Subaru.
Ughhh... starting to get a lot of warranty issues with the Edge, 10K on the clock and all of this;- Rattles galore (cargo area, console/gearshift area, instrument binnacle)- Clunking in sunroof when tilted or open and going over bumps or making turns- Driver's seat cushion trim massive bubble (new cushion base and trim on order from Japan)- Transmission shifting issues, particularly lurching under mild acceleration from a slow crawl (waiting on ECU calibration)- HOLD indicator turns itself on randomly for no reason- Cranking for 3-5 seconds before starting (happened a couple of times)15K service is going to be an all-dayer or 2, I feel. :(
My late model Camry had rattles too

Except the parking brake is not engaged, it's actually the VSC/ABS modulator that holds pressure. My hold light comes on at random times, when I'm not even touching the brake pedal or a few moments after starting with my foot released off the brake pedal.

Quite useful.https://www.toyota.com.au/-/media/toyota/main-site/vehicle-hubs/rav4/files/rav4-spec-data-may2019.pdfHi all,For some reason, Toyota have removed the combined cross spec table from the link above (I wonder why).If someone had downloaded it or know the alternate web location of this file, can you please share.  Thanks.The reason I am asking for May2019 spec is that now a Nov2019 spec table is available (same link, just replace may with nov at the end of the link), and I am curious as to what's actually changed.  So if anyone has a May spec table, please upload it.

Makes sense to give GXL something, was a bit too close to GX in spec but a bit too close to Cruiser in price
Good morning,Just after some info on the RAV 4 Hybrid GX 2.5L which I couldn't find online. Does anyone know what the range is on the EV battery?It's not for me personally, it's for a non-profit I belong to. Upgrading from a 2016 Suzuki Grand Vitara.We use it quite a bit (about 500km on average per week).Thanks
I am looking at the GXL 2WD. Saw a couple of posters paid $37k.Any more recent deals? Was thinking about $36,500 including mats, tint, petrol, slim plates and boot liner. Realistic?
Kelly Perazzolo writes...Does anyone know what the range is on the EV battery?Theres no real range on EV, unless you can drive the whole way under 30km/h.  I think ive read it could get 30-40km, but as soon as you give it a little extra throttle the engine will kick in.
Menco writes...Theres no real range on EV, unless you can drive the whole way under 30km/h.

Kelly Perazzolo writes...Does anyone know what the range is on the EV battery?It's more about the assistance that it gives the petrol engine.  For a fill of around 45 litres I get nearly 900 kms which IMO is outstanding.

Larry R writes...I'm still waiting for my hybrid to arrive ��� but judging from the reviews on youtube and common sense, the range is too small to be practical imho.Yep. 6-7km is what my dealer quoted. He also mentioned that forcing our RAV4 hybrids to EV mode is primarily intended to be used in caprparks/garages, in order to reduce the CO contents in those closed spaces.  Makes sense to me.
Larry R writes...I'm still waiting for my hybrid to arrive ��� but judging from the reviews on youtube and common sense, the range is too small to be practical imho.Thats why i first mentioned there is no real EV range as such

digital_silence writes...6-7km is what my dealer quoted.Don't believe everything dealers tell you. Average about 1-2km, low speed, light foot, flat road, full charge.
PinzVidz writes...full charge.Speaking of which ��� it never shows the full cyan bars on the hybrid battery icon displayed, no matter how long I drive around. Best I saw was one grey bar short to full.Does this mean the battery never gets fully charged? How else do you tell the state of charge, apart from that icon?
digital_silence writes...Does this mean the battery never gets fully charged? How else do you tell the state of charge, apart from that icon?The only time you'll see it go to full is after descending a mountain or long downhill stretch. If the HV battery can't take any more charge, the ECU utilises increased engine braking and conventional braking regardless of whether the gear lever is in D or B.
Menco writes...I got 5km on ev mode and could go further. But ran out of road before i got into traffic and couldnt keep it below 30.Just a point of interest regarding this........by no means an expert, but my understanding of battery tech is that there are correlations between depth of discharge and battery life.....as well as other variables.Bottom line.....be careful using the battery for unintended uses.....you may not enjoy the consequences....
digital_silence writes...Does this mean the battery never gets fully charged? How else do you tell the state of charge, apart from that icon?If you have a scanguage, it will show you that all hybrid batteries (Li-ion & NiMH) float between 40% to 80%. 60% being the resting position. Once the car runs up to 70%, the charge the hybrid system pushes into the battery drops on its way to 80%. This also dependent on the temp of the batteries also. TBH, I've only seen 80% a few times in my years of owning a hybrid and it occurs for example down the M6 heading into Wollongong or going down into Jenolan caves where the elevation drop is very very long and/or speeds are higher.To the regular consumer, the display showing fully charged is around 73-75%. Minimum is 40% and that's when the engine will kick in to charge it back to 50%. If you're in heavy traffic and the A/C is drawing a lot of power (again, this will vary depending on whether you've just turned it on in the past 5 mins), you will see it dip below 40%. I've personally seen close to 30% and anything below 37% is where I start to worry and park on the side of the road with A/C off to at least allow the system to get back up to 50%.
GiveItaWhirl writes...by no means an expert, but my understanding of battery tech is that there are correlations between depth of discharge and battery life.....LeadAcid ��� yes. LiIon ��� no. There is also a protection circuit inbuilt in the pack that cuts off further discharge if the 18650 cell voltage drops below approx 2.9V.  And it can stay in that state for quite a while ��� months if not years.SmellyTofu writes...If you have a scanguage, it will show you that all hybrid batteries (Li-ion & NiMH) float between 40% to 80%. I have not done any tests, but I can not see any benefits from the battery technology viewpoint of doing that. Or maybe just one: at the full charge state, the cell voltage is sitting close to 4.2V and after the start of the discharge drops down fairly quickly to the nominal cell voltage of 3.7V. Same at the end of SOC ��� it falls off the cliff from 3.7V to 3.0V just before full discharge. Perhaps the design relies on the cell voltage being around 3.7V for some other purposes.  This is all just my speculations.
GiveItaWhirl writes...Bottom line.....be careful using the battery for unintended uses.....you may not enjoy the consequences....There is plenty of protection around this ��� for our example, even if you force the hybrid to full EV mode by a buttonpress, the petrol engine will still kick in and take over when the EV battery will come near to full discharge.
deleted, forgot the quote!
digital_silence writes...There is plenty of protection around thisYes, and I assume the protection is there for a reason.......the point being taking the battery to full 'near' full discharge may have life shortening consequences.......may find the petrol kicking in a lot more often and a lot sooner.each to there own, YMMV etc, whatever, just sayin (:

I ordered a pearl white cruiser hybrid 2wd on 1st of August. Was told at the time a 4 month wait though could go to 6 months. At the end of October the dealer advised realistically it'll be arrive January though at the latest it'll be February. I followed up today and the response I got was that production is unknown. After digging further was told that it could push out to June.Has anyone who was ordered a cruiser hybrid around Late July or early August received their vehicle or been given a confirmed production /delivery month?

Had a call from the dealer today, ordered October expecting production February with delivery March/April.Was also mentioned a $350 increase because of the AUD vs the Yen, will find out more about this in due course.
bL@De writes...Was also mentioned a $350 increase because of the AUD vs the Yen, will find out more about this in due course.Isn't the contract for a fixed price? Or are dealers allowed to increase the price after the contract is signed?
Not sure don���t have access to the contract at present until next week, probably a clause in there though.Not much in the scheme of things but still why agree if they change it down the track.
creamypies writes...Isn't the contract for a fixed price?Nah. In our contract it says the price may change. But it does say if it does we can opt out of the contract due to this reason. Or something to this affect.
Yep, on mine says that if a price increase occurs you���ve got 3 days to cancel otherwise if they hear nothing back that means you���ve agreed to the new price.

Our dealer hasn���t mentioned anything price wise as yet and it has gone up since our contract. ( as many others ) I suppose it���ll come to the crunch when it gets here and they either wear it or inform us of the difference. But I would have thought they would have told us by now.

I ordered my car in August and I contacted the dealer about the price hike. Sales told me that they cannot increase the price as I have already signed the contract. (my car will be in production early next year)
Looking to purchase the new cruiser , anyone know what the life expectancy of the hybrid battery would be and replacement cost if died  , also is there any major issues with this car so far and is the transmission issue happening on or models or not ?
"For those who were keeping an eye on the portal tracking system, mine says at the moment"" Current status of your order:	Scheduled for production"".   Does it go from this to "" In Production""?  If so how long has it sat at "" scheduled for production "" for?? Cheers"
When I ordered mine I was shown the advisory bulletin regarding the price increase. There was a cut off date from memory sometime in Sep/Oct. Order before the date and no increase applies.I was aware of the upcoming increase (I ordered after the cut off date) so I made sure to get it in writing that my agreed price was the final price I'd pay when the car was delivered.

AU_Nexus691 writes...anyone know what the life expectancy of the hybrid battery would beGenerally life of the vehicle. Plenty of old Priuses still getting round with original HV batteries.
I only looked at the Rav after the News Corp award, would upgrade my 2018 Camry in  aheartbeat because I've been really happy with the hybrid. Rav hybrid fuel efficiency looks great for an SUV. Where's the HUD though? It's now a deal-breaker for me. Also ventilated seats is something I need in FNQ. Great looking car though, might take a test drive.
Signed a deal earlier this week on the GXL 2WD with the following:Blue TintFloor matsTank of petrolPremium platesDelivery by Xmas RRP about $41,700Got it for $37,750.I thought it could be had for less than $37k but was slightly surprised how tight the dealers were with discounts.

Interesting chat with a fleet sales guy today. He says that many customers, unable to secure a Hybrid within reasonable time-frames, are shifting their orders to the Edge model. Fleet buyers are usually under time pressure and cannot wait too long for delivery. He commented that I was unusual for a fleet customer, as I could comfortably wait the six months for delivery. I guess that means that hybrids are not making their way into fleets to the penetration that one might expect, but conversely, private buyers can often afford to wait and hence the sales numbers for hybrids are likely to be distorted towards private buyers
My story is probably very similar to lots others reading. We're in the market for a new vehicle and the RAV4 has caught my eye ��� both on the road (albeit very limited) and with the recent press awards.We popped into a SEQ dealer on Friday and had a test drive of a hybrid. It didnt blow me away, but it still ticks most of our boxes. It was a GLX but think we'd want a 2WD Cruiser.However, the dealer described  a 12 month wait!I've since found this thread and after a quick catch up I'm starting to think that timeframe wasnt the dealer simply being a bit conservative. This could be a killer.   :-(
Yeah I couldn't stomach a 12 month wait too. I had a few BTOs previously but never exceeded 4-5 months.
I was so lucky. I booked 2WD Cruiser, online and then the dealer said the earliest delivery will be in June if only I want a Pearl White, thought I picked a black one. I said fine, I will wait. Then one week after they've sent me an email that there would be Saturn Blue for early December because someone cancelled. I thought it's still close to black! So said yes, then the system showed that it would be here by 16/12/2019, however, I received a call on 6th and I received it on 7th with my sidestep. The only issue I have is my Android Auto is giving me an error about the time of the car GPS that is not synced with my phone! Error 14. I am going to fix it tomorrow.
Btw, the dealer explained to me why there is big waiting for Hybrid atm. The problem is Toyota Australia. They have to put the order for each car in advance for Toyota Japan, and tell them their sale plan a year earlier based on their market estimation and their analysis! Whatever is the number for new Rav4, they've ordered 30% Hybrid and 70% Petrol to Toyota! but now 80% of customers are asking for Hybrid! which was not planned!!! That shows Toyota Australia analysis was totally false!
It will probably get to a point where they just end up making hybrid standard (maybe next gen)Interestingly this was the car planned to be built alongside Camry at Altona if Toyota kept manufacturing in Australia. Probably would of freed up a lot of supply if that happened.

Are we in a Circus here? or at the world's car industry leader?  Having been dealing directly with many  Japanese businesses based in Japan, I dare to assume that the culprit is a local office.Sorry for this vent out ��� it's just that I have a strong allergy to bs.
DockTony writes...An economist would argue that they've seriously underpriced the hybrid!...or overpriced the petrol ��� look at the recently released pricing for HR-Vs (Koba) and the public/media response to that.

Yes it���s probably a combo. A 2.0 litre petrol RAV4 should probably start in high 20s or very low 30s on road . Hybrid is probably underpriced
I wonder if the demand for the hybrid would be as high if Toyota also sold the 2..5l + 8 speed auto FWD model like they do in the USA.The 2l base engine is a bit underpowered.
The 2.5 should be the base engine in this class of car. Helps justify the price premium over the cheaper 2.5 Camry too
Look at the Spec for the Camry and shows 2.5 or V6 3.5 Motor. and the Hybrid is 95 or better fuel
Hi guys, I'm looking at the 4WD Cruiser hybrid in either Crystal Pearl or Silver Sky, but I do have 2 questions.1) In regards to the interior colour, I really like the "ACCENTED NUTMEG LEATHER", but I'm a bit worried about wear and tear with 2 small kids on board... any feedback or recommendations?2) I do like the look and practicality of the optional side step, but is there maybe a downside to them, or a reason why I shouldn't get them?

We sat in a nutmeg leather car the dealer had waiting for delivery and it didn't do it for us and we've ended up with all black. I've had all black leather with kids (Mazda CX9) and that was fine. The nutmeg looked a bit of an after thought as so much of the interior is still the same black.
Cool, thanks for the feedback MMC.
If you guys were offered a brand new Edge, drive away today, or a brand new GXL Hybrid AWD, drive away in January,  for more or less the same price (~$45k), which would you choose?The way I see it:
phoneyhuh writes...If you guys were offered a brand new Edge, drive away today, or a brand new GXL Hybrid AWDHybrid thanks.
Just because of the reduced fuel consumption or another reason?
phoneyhuh writes...leather trimJust to correct you there, the Edge has Softex.
phoneyhuh writes...Edge has a LOT more features, including more powerful engine, better offroad capabilities, leather trim, 360deg camera, luxury features, etc etc.The Hybrid has a bit better fuel consumption. That's it.Almost base model vs top of the line model is a bit of a weird comparison though. The petrol engine maybe more powerful than just the petrol engine in the GXL AWD but the combined hybrid AWD petrol+electric is more than that.
are you sure that they can offer you the hybrid in Jan 2020  ? if so go for the AWD hybird , E-four is smart AWD systerm  as well .
Cruiser Hybrid 2.5L AWD looks like the best compromise while still offering the good fuel consumption, but that's out of stock until March.Maxwinner writes...are you sure that they can offer you the hybrid in Jan 2020  ?Yes, a black one.E-four is smart AWD systerm  as well .Sorry I have no idea what that is.

I'm just going by what the dealer is telling me. 1 GXL will be delivered sometime in Jan. 1 Cruiser to be delivered in March.I'm sort of failing to see why it's worth the wait for a paltry saving of a couple of litres of fuel per 100km.  Unless there's something else I'm missing?
phoneyhuh writes...I'm just going by what the dealer is telling me. 1 GXL will be delivered sometime in Jan. 1 Cruiser to be delivered in March.Ask the dealer that these timeframes are to be included in the contract and see what their response is. I will be surprised if they agree to it.
OK thanks. Will do. I'll be looking at them + several other makes/models this saturday.
phoneyhuh writes...Just because of the reduced fuel consumption or another reason?Fuel consumption is a big selling point for what is a medium and almost considered a large SUV.  It's a beautiful drive, quiet and smooth.  Plenty of torque to overtake when required.  Often leaves most at the lights if you want to.The Edge has had a few owner complaints too, things not working as intended.  I haven't seen any(?) reports (other than the sales hold for the brakes) where Hybrid owners are dissatisfied.What is it in the Edge that you think you'll need?  Do you feel that those extras will hold the value?  Most $50k cars are lucky to pull in $15k as trade after 4 years and normal use.A guide might be to see what Toyota Assist is offering on each vehicle after 4 years (Toyota Financial Services Program).  The program is a 'Guaranteed Buy Back' after the 4 years are up.  They give you an agreed (minimum, could be more) trade in value provided you get it serviced (anywhere) and stay under the agreed kilometres.You could compare both 'minimums' with the same other conditions and just see what's what.I'd bet money too that over time (and I get that there'll be a sweet spot) the AWD GXL Hybrid will hold it's value WAY above the petrol Edge in the private market.I guess that'll pan out in the years ahead.
phoneyhuh writes...Edge, drive away today, or a brand new GXL Hybrid AWD, drive away in January,  for more or less the same price (~$45k), which would you choose?The edge for 45 k driveway is a good price on a side note. From what I have seen. It���s main downfall for me is it doesn���t have 2 person electronic seat memory for the drivers seat which is a let down. I would have thought it would have been closer to 50 k after a bit of movement. But they must want to shift them. But bit of a different comparison. As you said , would possibly be better if a fair bit of off-road use was planned. And does have quite a few more mod cons than the GXL. But onlyIf you see them as adding value to you personally.
phoneyhuh writes...The Hybrid has a bit better fuel consumption. That's it."A bit" is 4.7 vs 7.3 (claimed).  Not quite twice but nearly 60%. Even if they lie (I actually get 5.2 easily from my Cruiser Hybrid), their lie corrections would be the same for both figures. So, we are talking Petrol Edge to be 60% higher on fuel consumption per km than GXL Hybrid.With the petrol prices like they are now ($1.50+) and say average (conservative!) one fuel tank a week (55L), we are talking about $50/week saving. Meaning that the difference in price between Hybrid/NonHybrid will be paid off in just one year!
Wazza77 writes...It���s main downfall for me is it doesn���t have 2 person electronic seat memory for the drivers seatWazza, you said everyone around you hates your eclectic blue! Why would you then worry about the 2nd memory for the driver seat? :-)))
digital_silence writes...we are talking about $50/week saving.More like $50 per month if you do an average of 15000km a year. That's around $600 per year for most people. Not enough for me to justify the difference.
phoneyhuh writes...Just because of the reduced fuel consumption or another reason?Just the refinement alone. The hybrid is a dream to cruise with, and tons of power with the battery input when needed.For me, all the extra bells and whistles add no value. Ive often read the 360 camera is a bit rubbish anyway.If its for offroad, better off getting a true 4x4 imo.Like others have said, people will be looking for the hybrids over the edge on the second hand market. I think the wait time speaks volumes about that

digital_silence writes...Why would you then worry about the 2nd memory for the driver seat? :-)))Yeh good point. But it is mainlyFor the missus ! I am keeping my clubsport for me as a daily. But we are very different heights and such and really need the 2 person memory to make it worthwhile. Especially with the sunroof lowering head height a bit. As we will swap every now and then.
Actually on a side note I didn���t enjoy driving the hybrid compared to the constant running of the petrol engine. Our test seemed to cut in and out when slowing and have a noticeable whine to it in the hybrid.  But we also only do around 7500 Kay���s a year so fuelEconomy isn t a big thing for us. I mean , as it is I own two V8s so it���s never been a massive concern.
Menco writes...If its for offroad, better off getting a true 4x4 imo.Thats what I've currently got, but it's overkill for the inner-city where I live and plus I could count on one hand the number of times per year I go off-road these days. Been there done that kinda thing, but I would still like AWD and a bit of clearance for semi-rough terrain.Here is the thread I started for this journey if you want to know my background:  /archive/9lymzyp3The Rav4 is a serious contender among a couple of others in it's class. Or the next level up.As for klms per year, 3.5k for commuting. Plus maybe another 10k at the most for trips around town, weekends away etc so not too bothered about fuel consumption. Resale value is a worthy point however.
Edge cons: More fills between tanks, moo drivetrain noise, not as powerful, lurching (though a fix is here), more expensive 19��� replacement, limited true off-road tyre options without going to 17��� or 18���.Hybrid pro���s: Faster, close to 1000km per tank, smoother, seat memory, hybrid drivetrain characteristics.The pro of the Edge such as ���off-road��� capabilities (not seen one in true sand beach yet on YouTube), vented seats and tough look still doesn���t outweigh the hybrid in any grade.Buying a car isn���t a cost saving exercise. It���s the driving experience the reason why I chose hybrid but each to their own. Do what you think, not what randoms think. It���s your money.
Thanks smellytofu, that was a great and succinct comparison write up.  I think my mind is made up, I suppose it now boils down to GXL vs Cruiser in the hybrid, and what sort of truthyness I can get from that dealer.(Notwithstanding the other contenders those being ex-demo XC40, Disco sport and new Forester)
I had initially ordered my RAV4 with the nutmeg interior. Sales guy and his assistant both warned against it as not looking great and reducing sales value. I then got into a Kluger with similar upholstery. Within a minute, my order had changed to black interior

Please show me.My math on the previous page is correct, but I found the error in my given conditions: On my old car (V6), I used to fuel up every week on average (doing >500Km a week), and that's the pattern I used in my calcs. But for the figures you and I used (4.7/7.3) I 'd need only to fuel up once every 2-3 weeks. So, I was in fact comparing my savings between old car and new Cruiser, not Edge vs GXL. Agreed, that was wrong.  However... Your math is correct, but I would question the validity of your assumptions too:1) Average annual car travel in AU is around 15000, but according to all forums, this statistics is heavily pulled down by house mums & old ladies doing only to and from schools/shops on (say) "Yarris". Those users never consider upgrading to Hybrid, so are out of our interest. From what I see from people's posting, the SUV typical travel is more like 25K, but let's be conservative and say it is 20K.2) As I said, 4.7/7.3 are claimed figures. The real figures in the real day by day city average driving conditions, I'd say, will be more like 5.5/8.5 (even higher for country driving).Therefore, your calculated annual savings number for typical realistic SUV usage, imho, needs to be scaled as follows :$585 * (20/15) * (5.5/4.7) = $912, and this would be the realistic estimate of petrol savings per year between Edge vs GXL Hybrid.

There are more benefits than just fewer fuel consumptions in riding a hybrid car, especially if you are commuting around city or high traffic areas.1- My favourite reason is no idling car anymore!  No matter waiting for someone or in traffic, enjoy your electric power when cannot move,  or for any reason, you need your vehicle to be on but with no movement, and no waste of fuel! Fantastic! Isn't it?2- Great instant torque that you have to try! That's because how hybrid engine is working and that is what I call hybrid characteristic.3- One more important reason! It has a lower emission! Which means helping your environment cleaner, also at least in victoria there is a $100 DISCOUNT for your rego of hybrid cars! More save, now its $700 saved per year that you can spend on sth else! One more reason! Wasting less time in refilling your tank! Personally, I am lazy to refill the petrol, and I like to postpone this always! But it probably not my only motivation!4- Not only saving but also enjoying the traffic! Or any carpool situation! not worried about fuel waste or engine damage! Activate all radars and active cruise control and do not worry about anything than a piece of music or a pleasant conversation if you are with another passenger! So again, save $100, having a cleaner environment and enjoy the traffic! In the USA, in highways, hybrid car drivers, even though they are driving alone, they are still allowed to drive in HOV lane in jam time!5- Practice for the future as the future would be electric cars, and that helps you justify your driving habits and skills when you are driving a hybrid car, plus all hybrid cars in the world are usually high-performance cars.6- Like others said high resale value in Hybrid cars is common since usually Hybrid vehicles are equipped well too.So yes, it is saving, yes, you may not buy a car to save money! But hey! Why not when you can! But more valuable than money to me is fewer emissions and cleaner tailpipes! And not worried about the idle times! The other technical Hybrid characteristic is also an add on for me. And yes it is a driving type, it would be your choice at the end. Like it or not like it.
Third time lucky for a reassuring comment about your black interior ,not going to get it here .Nutmeg was the best interior color decision we have made in years,well worth the 3 month wait from May.You should have stayed with the nutmeg & not got talked out of it by the overly nice concerning salesman.But all comes down to personal preference I guess...
As above. for grahampeters

I am convinced that in my case (yours may be different) the saving would be more than $912/year for Edge vs Hybrid, and that's all that matters for me. Everyone believes in what they want to believe.  Some even believe in "actual figures" of 4.7L/100Km.

As a regular contributor in this forum, I felt the need to call out misrepresentative information like yours.the saving would be more than $912/year for Edge vs HybridThe representative figure is about $600 per year for Edge vs hybrid and about $540 for the other petrol models.I'll ask you to show me the picture of the "actual figure" of quoted 6.5 for your GXL when you get it.Everyone's driving style is different so you really can't make an objective comparison. Therefore the most reliable basis would be to use the official figures obtained from the official tests.

SLedGE writes...What's not to like?Other than the price difference  ( to go to the hybrid ) i didnt really like the drive of the hybrid compared to the petrol.It seemed weird and a bit rough when the motor was kicking in and such, and also an electric style of whine when slowing down. May have been our demo, but i didnt like the way it drove at all. Mind you the 2 L isnt the quietest. But for us fuel economy isn't a big worry doing around 7500 ( maybe ) kms a year. I also wonder how intrusive the artificial sound is going to be when implemented. People mention they love the quietness of the hybrid, but after seeing some youtube samples that may change when people are driving slowly and having the vehicle emit a sound to warn pedestrians. I assume this is something that will be implemented here in Oz at some stage due to safety reasons??Oh and on the topic of power, im not to worried about that. Seemed to go ok on the test and is only for running around for the other half mainly. We have some petrol guzzling v8s if we want horsepower !

Hey guys, for those who bought their Rav4 during the promotional period, what's the process of claiming the $500 fuel gift card after taking delivery of your vehicle?
Mine was 10 days
I like that you can still get the school and red camera warning with android auto. Seems to all work as intended. Nice having google maps, just dont get the turn guidance in the dash now. No big loss there as it blocked the digital speedo anyways
On the related subject: The road speed sign recognition in RAV4 is said to be genuine, that is by using the camera. According to the non-verified info that I have, the so-called "recognition" in our close rival Mazda CX-5 is actually done by GPS location and 100% relies on the maps being up-to-date. Meaning that it will not recognise the temporary signs if they are not on the currently installed map.  RAV4 will.Can someone comment on that?  Is this true or not?

Likewise, why would you want a hybrid that also has a plug?The plug in is a pain... but if you have the infrastructure at home (solar panels), then it makes sense to simply plug it in when u get home and let it charge overnight... then you have free 100km of drive...I also wonder if when on petrol it charges both batteries?The most impressive component is the 100km of battery drive. You get none of that on the hybrid.

Has anyone who have the hybrid versions for a while noticed any petrol tank filling inconsistencies as experienced by some North American owners documented herehttps://www.rav4world.com/threads/have-you-had-trouble-filling-your-hybrid-gas-tank.300662/
No problems here
Has anyone who have the hybrid versions for a while noticed any petrol tank filling inconsistencies as experienced by some North American owners documented hereNo issues here at all ��� like every car I have to slow it down as it starts to get full so as to let the air escape and not let it choke at the spout. Obviously if you pump it in full blast the pump will automatically shut off prematurely due to the sensor at the nozzle sensing too much fumes in the fill and thinking it is an overflow.
mrXO writes...Has anyone who have the hybrid versions for a while noticed any petrol tank filling inconsistencies as experienced by some North American owners documented hereNo, I think much of the complaints come from the idiots who like to whinge about nothing. I have hired plenty of cars in the US and had similar problems with their petrol stations. Many self fill and have a stupid rubber plug over the spout that we don't have. My thought is that this causes pressure issues as I had similar issues on each car I drove there causing all to experience issues with getting it full. Reading the complaints prior to my Cruiser Hybrid arriving the description was the same and had most going around in circles.

My RAV 4 cruiser has just gone into production!

Wrrr writes...I can confirm my rav4 Hybrid cruiser AWD recognises temporary roadworks signs and the displays it on the dashboard.Mine today didn't recognise the temp electronic speed signs (displayed on the roadservice vehicle big LED tableau's)  :-)Although, it recognized the "limit ahead" sign (where the speed limit sign is all black&white).On cruise control if I suddenly come to a reduced speed zone I simply hold down the ���-��� button for a few seconds and the speed immediately drops down to the traffic signed speed limit recognised by the car.Is that in the manual? I tried this today and it didn't work: holding the "-" button just changes the step of speed setpoint adjustment from 1km/h to 5km/h , but the setpoint itself goes way below the recognized speed limit sign displayed on both the main unit (where GPS, radio, phone etc) and on the TFT in front of the driver.

1vic@ writes...Where I disagree or am somwhat confused.. the Prime provides everything the non Prime version does, but with the added feature of plug in, or more importantly drive on battery for 60km, which is more than enough for day to day driving??Not sure if I understand your question, but to me, the linked article, and the Toyota���s VP S&M quotes from it, make very little sense, if at all. That guy, Sean Hanley, said:It's not that we can't bring plug-in hybrids to market. We can, at some point. It's whether or not the market will accept it, Right now, Australian consumers are clearly, in my opinion, voting for hybrid electric. I don't know why anyone else isn't seeing that. It's certainly what we're seeing.We are seeing that, Sean. We are in fact the ones who voted. However, how can you compare the demand for what's available with the demand for what's NOT available??? To give the consumers the chance of their GENUINE voting (by their money), all candidates should be available for purchase.  At least, for preorder. Of course, consumers vote for hybrids, because they can't (physically and technically) do for plug-in hybrid. Come on Toyota! Stop making handwavy statements, bring the plug in hybrid here and compare the demand! You don't even have to bring the physical cars ��� just open the preorders. From what I can see reading this thread, I'd say about 70%+ of RAV4 Hybrid owners (me included) or buyers would switch to, or rather go for in a first place, plug in hybrid, if we could. (subject to the price, I guess) How's that for the demand comparison, Sean?
Who's going to train the dealerships when repairs are required? What about smash repairers on how to handle the much bigger battery system? What about the homologation to tick the ADR boxes?Whilst I appreciate as much as anyone else to just bring the thing in as now a consumer, for a business, there are more considerations that needs to happen similar to way back in 2001 when the business decided to bring the first Prius to the tiny Australian market.Then there's Japan to even allow it to be imported. Sean can only lobby for it. ADR is still a barrier plus the fact Australia is still a "hot" climate even if ADR was abolished with bigger radiator cores/trans cooler if they determine it to be required and available on the production line.
I could go to every point in details, Tofu, but that would distract us from the big picture.You brought up the valid points, but they are all related to TOYOTA���S SIDE considerations of business viability of bringing the plug in hybrid (PIH) to Au. Sean Hanley, however, has attributed the reasons for not bringing the PIH here, to CONSUMERS SIDE, not to Toyota.In short, he said:"We can bring it in, but you guys don't want it" which is quite different from saying:"You guys may or may not want it, so it's too bothersome for us to bring it".The truth is the latter, but he said the former.Sales & Marketing at its best.
PHEV would be the way to maintain with Mitsubishi's product but there's still a more of a focus around getting more numbers than sustainable/responsible personal transportation.Again, if you want it and someone builds the RAV4 plug-in in RHD, then you're free to bring it in. Manufacturers no longer have a monopoly on what we can and can't have coz if they won't do it, SEVS will fix it.Btw, there's a lot of "I think" thinking there. Carplay and AA as an example. I was talking about it in 2014 and got knocked back coz they thought they knew better/scared of letting control of the user experience to another company who clearly knew more about UX than any clunky car company.
Anyone have to pay extra from contract price due increase in Rav4's RRP? My contract says they can increase the price if RRP changes.Dealership gave an indication around $500 stating they are yet to calculate it. The increase in RRP is just $300. Is that fair?I got it cheaper than previous RRP. Should it be proportional to contract price or they can charge you whatever they want?Ordered Rav4 GXL 2wd hybrid end of June, I was notified by dealer delivery due Jan 2020.
We ordered in June and picked it up last Friday. We didn't pay any extra on top of the price on the contract.

If you do not take the car on new RRP increase, someone else who need the car straightway may pay more than you to get the car when you cancel the contract and dealer can make more money.

Where does Toyota advertise 3 years of free map updates on ALL models? To my knowledge it only applies to Camrys.However, if asked, the dealers will certainly apply the current map 'update' at no cost where a new vehicle is supplied with out of date maps. My Aug 19 build Rav4 came with April 18 maps, and the update applied in Dec 19 was to April 19 maps. To my knowledge, Toyota only updates maps once each year, around April.Personally, I like the integration of the Toyota navigation with other vehicle functions. I had the free android / apple carplay install performed, and tried it out with Android, then switched it off as I prefer the 'native' Toyota nav / audio / bluetooth phone functionality. Updates erase personal data and non-default options, so be ready to re-apply these.By the way, I found zero wait time in Oct 19 for a white AWD hybrid GX. 3500km on, my fuel consumption calculated at refills is consistently below 5l/100km in city or highway, unless I use roof racks. The trip computer is a bit pessimistic in its calculations.Can't imagine why anyone would pay thousands more (and wait months for delivery) for squashed exhaust pipes, harder ride and other 'luxury' features on more expensive versions.

Each to their own fashion and style preferences of course, but leather is a terrible material in functional terms for car seats in the tropics. Sheep skin covers are very functional, and comparatively inexpensive even in designs that work with side airbags in the Rav4. Scotch-guard is enough on the rear fabric seats unless a physical cover is needed to protect from the kids, grand kids or fur kids. As for "leather" trim, I understand it is just vinyl. Toyota has had to stop advertising " leather" steering wheel & gear knobs. I find the soft-finish steering wheel on the GX very functional.
r-g-b writes...By the way, I found zero wait time in Oct 09 for a white AWD hybrid GXDo you mean oct 2019 ? Or have we gone back in time ??
Yes, 2019, originally supplied with 2018 maps. Corrected now. Sorry for the mistake; the decades pass so quickly!
kurt1 writes...Anyone have to pay extra from contract price due increase in Rav4's RRP? My contract says they can increase the price if RRP changes.I have been told by the dealer that the real price increase is $300 for November build onwards which they can legally pass on via T&C's. I think if you want the car then the $300 is reasonable although like others said dealers very rarely pass it on.I got my AWD Cruiser at less than the RRP as well and now dealer is not happy. Got a $2,500 discount back late May and car is due to arrive in early Jan so my dealer has now said i have 3 options. Either pay full price for the car because of price rise, (and lose $2,500 discount), pull out of the deal (so they can sell at full price to somebody else), or push me to the back of the queue and wait another 6-9 months so they can sell my car (due to arrive in Jan) to somebody at full price, and only then will they honour my discount because there will be lots more cars available then. Seems like a signed contract doesn't count for much when i comes to car salesman, now working out what to do....

They can't then arbitrarily take back the discount you arrived at.I'd say ok cancel the contract and get your deposit back.Let them see how they go trying to sell a 2019 built rav4 in 2020 as full price as stock becomes more available

Biff15 writes...Either pay full price for the car because of price rise, (and lose $2,500 discount), pull out of the deal (so they can sell at full price to somebody else), or push me to the back of the queue and wait another 6-9 months so they can sell my car (due to arrive in Jan) to somebody at full priceThat not right! if you paid deposit and have a contract with delivery date (which is probably over due), they should supply the car as per contract price, its not our fault that it took them so long to deliver that your order has been subjected to price increase. They're probably harassing you so they can sell the car at higher price.

Biff15 writes...Got a $2,500 discount back late May and car is due to arrive in early JanIf you ordered in May the car should have been here by late August / early Sept (mine was), so I would assume you've already been 'bumped' a couple of times. The Toyota Order Tracking System would have been your friend here, though I'll bet that you were told it wasn't available for the RAV4 (signalling the intention to optionally 'bump' you).I agree that they can only charge the extra $300 (if deplorable).....

So just put this out there for our fellow new RAV4 owners , After owning a new Rav4 cruiser for less than a week it came up with the following error code while driving "Drive-Start Control Malfunction" this is on the petrol cruiser not the hybrid modelAfter taking it to the dealer I purchased it from it , they found the oxygen sensor has failed and Toyota has grounded the car due to the risk of engine damage  , the dealer said there is a issue with the sensor on the new Rav4 and Corolla  the dealer said they have had 3 come in with the same issue and the issue is under investigation with Toyota , the worst part is there is nil stock of the sensor anywhere and may not get the car back until mid January
AU_Nexus691 writes...may not get the car back until mid JanuaryToyota has a policy in place where a courtesy car is provided if a vehicle is off the road due to a warranty issue/no parts for a period of time. If you don't have a vehicle from them, ask for one.
Yeah they organised the hire car ,bit disappointing that they don't have replacement stock but I'm guessing if there is an issue with the part and it's deemed a manufacture fault with the sensor they will probably either do a service bulletin or recall depending on the severity of the issue
Prices in a table like https://bit.ly/2X56mkN are meaningless without details of trade in and accessories. A major factor in any discount below rrp is the balance between supply and demand (not presently in a potential rav4 hybrid buyer's favour). Other factors like the dealer's proximity to monthly or annual sales quotas or bonus levels are generally not advertised. So you just have to look up the rrp for your preferred model, work out a fair retail price for your trade, phone about availability of the model you want, then go in and negotiate. It will go like this: Let's say your trade in is worth $10,000 by private sale. The dealer will start with an insulting offer of $2,500 and tell you that they have to cover marketing costs, warranty, etc. etc. After a good deal of haggling,  when you are about to leave to check other dealers or sell your old car privately before making any purchase, they will come up to $5,000 trade. But the contract will show $3,000 trade and $2,000 "allowance" (discount) off the rrp. The actual amounts depend on factors like those mentioned above.  So long as you are happy with the change-over price (and any wait or other contract conditions), all is well. But what was the drive-away price?: a meaningless question/answer without all the details.
FYI ���  Just so you know there is also quite a few 2019 Toyota Rav4 been brought into Australia with 18" wheels not 19" which they should be , Toyota is offering $1500 rebate on these models which is fully supported by Toyota's WarrantyWe took up this offer as the wait time for a cruiser with 19's was going to be around March- April 2020
Does anyone know where to find the parts list with diagrams for the external body of the 2019Rav4 cruiser AWD hybrid? I damaged the silver trim at the lower part of the front bumper and want to replace this.
Also would anyone know where to find the paint code of the silver trim?

After 1 week it brought up the Malfunction Indicator Lamp. Initial response was "It will probably be a week or so before we can get one". I was lucky as the dealer had another new RAV in stock (not sure what model) and removed the sensor off it to get me going again.I sent a message to Toyota to tell them how ridiculous it was that they did not have a part that can commonly fail in stock. Maybe you can do the same although I doubt it will make any difference?

Does it need to be towed to dealer ??
I think you'll need Part# 52711-42140-B0. Approx $180 on PartSouq before shipping. Can't help with the paint code unfortunately.Thanks very much mate. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out. I ordered the part off the website and will fit it myself.I don���t even trust my dealer to wash my car, let alone do bodywork. This gives me so much scope to DIY my own repairs without paying through my nose for poor quality service and labour from the dealerships.
no it didnt need to be towed, the warning note came up on the dashboard  with the check engine light  ,  if it happens to your car just baby it to you closest dealership , driving under heavy acceleration with a defective oxygen sensor could make the engine run lean and damage your engine
AU_Nexus691 writes...driving under heavy acceleration with a defective oxygen sensor could make the engine run lean and damage your enginemodern cars have more than one O2 sensor. If the ecu has  determined there is an issue that could lead to engine damage it will go into limp mode
it didnt go I.to limp mode from what I could tell while driving it to the dealership
So just got a call from the dealership today ,  they said it could be up to 4 weeks before they "might" get stock of the new sensor , the service manager said that this issue is worldwide and a massive batch of these sensors are affected
This may be more delays on top of the battery for people waiting in line. This wait is going to be something!

anyone got this fuel gauge indicator issue they have in US model?https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Discussion-t84538_ds1050648mainly for hybrid model.
Have a look at rav4 world. There are about 3000 entry���s about that problem. It���s mainly a US and Canadian problem.
jnu123 writes...anyone got this fuel gauge indicator issue they have in US model?This has been asked a lot in the Aus Facebook group and no one here has reported having the problem.
The issue is apparently unknown outside the USA. I have read many of the US posts that seem to be misunderstanding the point at which the RAV4 shows "Empty". The total fuel tank size is about 55 litres and the "Empty warning still has been about 5-15 litres remaining. This is consistent with my experience in a Kluger which shows "Empty" with 16 litres remaining in the tank. Running a fuel tank totally dry is not a great idea as there is an accumulation of crud at the bottom of the tank and the submerged fuel pump relies on immersion in fuel for lubrication and cooling If i interpret the distance traveled and distance to empty read-outs correctly, they seem to suggest the full calculated fuel load is about 45 litres (approximately 10 Imperial Gallons, implying about 10 litres remains in my tank or a bit over 2 Imperial Gallons.All of the posts I have seen sound as if they are seeking to fill up the air space and carbon canister that sits at the top of the tank.
Anyone seen this level 2 autonomous driving kit from Comma AI from the person that started the iPhone jailbreak all those years ago? Looking at the YouTube use cases can Toyota safety sense, this package is all over what Toyota offers. Seems to fit a lot of Toyota incl RAV4https://comma.ai/
Has anyone seen a boot mat that also covers the back of the rear seats?The US has an OEM mat that is rubber and covers both the boot and the seats. Appears we just get the el cheapo version here.

Ive had a couple of times now when the car has beeped and dash flashed with BRAKE in nice bold red. First time i was taking a corner and went slightly over white line with a parked car up ahead, so possibly my bad. 2nd time was a straight road and nothing in my lane. Some cars in opposite lane. Glad its never applied the brakes itself, but its a tad concerning when the car just randomly blares beeps out for nothing.

For those watching the tracking portal , how long after the car landed , as in , in Toyota���s holding yard , did it take for you to pick up the car ? We are in the east coast , do they come in to Brisbane and get transported from there to your local dealer ? Or do most cars come in to the west coast ? Possibly a silly question. Ours has just landed somewhere and they reckon we can pick up on the 20th jan.

Possibly a silly question.Ours has just landed somewhere and they reckon we can pick up on the 20th jan.Cars get dropped off at Brisbane, Wollongong, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth, usually the port closest to the dealer where the car is going to ( there are exceptions when dealers swap cars before they arrive and it is too late to Port swap them ).Yours has most likely been unloaded off the ship and is waiting in an Autocare services facility for them to come back to work and run it through the local build process, attach compliance plates, put the correct manuals in and carry out inspections to makes sure nothing has happened to it during transit.Then it will be shipped to your dealer where it will be stripped of all protective plastic wrapping, hav3 the pre delivery inspection, detail and clean, any dealer fit accessories added and then registered and plates attached.From ship docking to you picking up your car is usually 10-14 working days to metro dealers, a bit longer for rural, however with the holidays at this time of year allow 5-10 more working days..... so 20th sounds about right.

We had had our finance sorted a while ago when looking but as the car took 3 -4 months before build our finance approval expired. All good as we won���t have an issue with re approval. But we���re waiting for VIN and for it to be in the boat and with Chrissy and that before I know it it���s landed. So should have heaps of time to get finance sorted again before we actually get to pick it up. It was first thought end of jan and pushed back but then came forward and bam the car is in oz. so will get it sorted this week so we are ready to go when it���s right to pick up. Cheers again
Hi All,A couple of questions I was hoping to get some advice on as our new car is due mid Jan (still unable to get tracking but have given up and going on the dealer's word).Dealer set options, I was reading earlier in the forum that there are some functions that the dealer could only set through tech stream. What have people done, IE prior to delivery did you just give the dealer a list of items you want to be changed for the car? Also where there any that you changed that you wish you didn't? Or ones that you did and are really happy with it?Any recommendations for insurance for Rav 4, what have people gone with?Thanks for the advice
BeerMonkeyGreen writes...word).Dealer set options, I was reading earlier in the forum that there are some functions that the dealer could only set through tech stream.Dunno mate. Hopefully others can help you out. Ours is also due for pick up mid jan. it has just landed in oz. petrol cruiser. I spose once I have the car I am going to have a look through the detailed online manual I have and see if there are other things I want to change and get them to look at it at its first service. Only one thing I did I read I liked was the ability to hold the unlock button down and it opens all the windows and sunroof at once to let heat escape. Seems handy with out summers. Enjoy the purchase mate. We are looking forward to it.
I read through the dealer set options on page 382-292 of the manual and cannot see any that would leap out at me as requiring change. I suggest that you download the .pdf of each of the manuals from the Toyota site.Despite having my RAV4 Hybrid AWD Cruiser for two weeks, I am still reading the manual and working out how it all workshttps://toyotamanuals.com.au/#/?q=eyJidWlsZE1vbnRoIjpudWxsLCJidWlsZFllYXIiOm51bGwsImRvY3VtZW50VHlwZSI6bnVsbCwia2V5d29yZCI6IjIwMTkgUkFWNCIsIm1vZGVsTmFtZSI6bnVsbCwic2VhcmNoZWQiOnRydWUsInNob3dBZHZhbmNlZCI6ZmFsc2UsInBhZ2luYXRpb24iOnsicGFnZSI6MSwicGVyUGFnZSI6MTJ9fQ==
Just put an order on a Cruiser hybrid.Thought I would provide an update on the ETA situation for anyone looking to buy ��� 8 months...Lets hope Toyota actually do increase production rate in 2020.
Ordered GXL AWD Hybrid with few accessories (tow bar, rubber mats, rubber boot liner, tint, full tank petrol, slim plates) in Crystal Pearl on 30 Dec.Vehicle already on the boat so expected delivery is mid Feb!
Toyota and their dealers have done a great job in hyping up this car, they love nothing more than pre orders at a price they want you to pay.Think you might find the wait list will miraculously clear up in the next few months.They will also fix the early faults and bugs that occur in every complete new model.

@SmellyTofu yeah we got lucky that the dealer had an incoming car that matched what we wanted.Hopefully, the new year brings better communications from Toyota regarding your order

Ordered just before Christmas. GXL AWD Hybrid Crystal Pearl. Actually wasn't my first choice of colour but I was matching with a car that will be delivered in Feb.My understanding is that some dealers massively over sold their allocations of the cars leading to longer wait times for some people depending on the dealer.
Cloudripper writes...My understanding is that some dealers massively over sold their allocations of the cars leading to longer wait times for some people depending on the dealer.The demand seems to be more around the AWD Cruiser Hybrid rather than the middle of the pack GXL.Wait times could be for many reasons depending on what you want to believe, so far we've had battery shortage, brake fault I think it was, unexpected demand, wrong rims / tyres.Will probably never know the truth behind it, I went into it expecting a 10-12 month wait, have been told Feb production so anything less than 12 months is a bonus for me.
It would have to be grade mix forecast incorrect but even after this period since launch that you'd see a recovery kick in.

Are dealers given a quota with some forward selling more than others?
DockTony writes...Are dealers given a quota with some forward selling more than others?Correct, all dealers get allocated a number of cars each month that they can forward order, either for stock or for customer orders when the have a sales contract to fulfill ��� usually for arrival in around 4 months time depending on location of manufacture.Larger dealers will be allocated more cars, smaller ones fewer, based on previous sales history and a few other parameters that are only really known within Toyota.
I placed an order for a hybrid gxl 2wd in saturn blue in mid Nov. Was originally quoted a 6month wait (ETA May). Got a call from my dealer today that Toyota has increased production and my car will start production late Jan / early Feb and 4 wks for delivery after that.He said the boost is based on demand, with some models /colours got a big boost while some others has less. I'm guessing the more popular whites/greys got the boost while my dark blue boot so much.
Sylphier writes...Got a call from my dealer today that Toyota has increased production and my car will start production late Jan / early Feb and 4 wks for delivery after that.That's great to hear, I placed an order too in early Nov and was told minimum 6 month wait, more likely 8 and possibly 12 so it's great the wait times are starting to come down. Fingers crossed mine comes earlier than 6 months too :)
The intriguing thing is that this is a problem solely in the USA and solely for hybrids. However, from looking at parts lists and diagrams on Partsouq, the fuel tank and components appear to be identical between the hybrid and non-hybrid and are not unique to the USA. accordingly, you have to wonder whether it is a case of rumours running away

No it effect���s Canadian and Japan built Cars.
I think the US has a different fuel nozzle system to ours, it's why the Honda's in the US have a cap-less fuel tank nozzle but Australian models still have the cap.
Anyone here ordered a Cruiser AWD Hybrid in late July/early August and still waiting for it?Have you received updates from your dealer?
I���ve been receiving updates but basically telling me my car is delayed by another month.

I got an okay one, which honestly was the reason why I was fine with an extra 3 month wait but now I���m being told every month it���s the next month and it���s reached a point where I���m looking at other car brands because I���ve lost some faith.If they told me from today it���ll take 6 months, I���d be fine but it���s the constant email every month saying it���s next month and it happening again.

I actually got it from a pal who works at toyota HQ I just wanted to check when I didn���t hear from my dealer what it said about my October build. So they must just be moving me down the list I guess. Going to get friend to check again and see based on what they���ve said now.Is anyone finding the online tracking helpful?
Is anyone finding the online tracking helpful?My tracking details don't even work!
needanewname19 writes...Is anyone finding the online tracking helpful?Found it very helpful, knew where the car was from scheduled production through to arrival at the dealer.Though had to go through Toyota Australia and they contacted the dealer directly (as the dealer was pulling the RAV4 isn't on the tracking system card). I was then called by the dealer and somewhat begrudging given the login details.........I made sure I stayed on the phone whilst I tried to login, and the first details given were incorrect........then when I said I guess it's back to Toyota Australia to advise them the system doesn't work the correct logon details were miraculously spotted on their screen and given.....It was all very polite, but you really need to understand what's going on with the bumping etc
I have been informed I am unable to get the password until it has been confirmed for production.I don���t believe it but what can you do, still scheduled for February production last I heard.Edit: My batch number starts with 9 and 7 digits in total
bL@De writes...Edit: My batch number starts with 9 and 7 digits in totalI think that because they have different field names for the same number things get muddied.See below-------the 1st name is the Tracking System Login page, the 2nd is in the Dealers database and the 3rd is once you are in the Tracking System itself.The details you need arehttps://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/User Code = Retail Sales Order = Customer Order NumberPassword = Batch Number = Access CodeIt seems obvious the dealer must have must have the Retail Sales Order number.Confirming my Batch Number started with 9 and had 7 numbers.I'm thinking they figure that most won't press them for the info, and if you won't press for the info then you'll probably also take being bumped.  Some sort of test of the customers resolve (;https://www.toyota.com.au/contactI went through the General Enquiries Number
I might have (/probably) missed it in the manual but is there a quick way to turn off the info screen without manually going through menu / display / off?Like double tapping a button or dial (similar to how to turn on the radio)?
Yeah, it took me 3 or 4 tries to get my tracking details. I asked their Facebook page for it after getting nowhere from my salesman and all of a sudden my salesman had it lol.
Wow, sounds like the communication is really sucky for a few of you.When I got my log in details, they accidentally gave me another customers. So I���ve had two tracking details.Are any of you thinking of cancelling your order based on your treatment?

Assuming a 6 to 8 month wait for the current 2020 model (available since approx mid/late 2019).Wouldn't it be better to wait for the updated 2021 rav4 model(s) to become available presumably middle/late this year or to see what other manufacturers release in the mean time? Rather than to give the dealer a deposit and sit in a waiting list with no discount or preorder benefit to you as a customer and with the potential for price increases to be passed onto you.....
I was also told I wouldn���t have access to the portal until my car was marked to be built. Once I got it it wasOn orderThen ready for productionThen in production Then in the ship before I know it and is sitting in the transport companies storage yard for delivery to my local dealer. Should have it end next week hopefully. Seemed a quick process once it Started ! Been around 4 months and that���s for a petrol cruiser.  Didn���t want a hybrid but if I did the wait woulda killed me the way they are going for the cruiser.

Rather than to give the dealer a deposit and sit in a waiting list with no discount or preorder benefit to you as a customer and with the potential for price increases to be passed onto you...Dunno. Spose it���s hard to tell. May only end up in a long queue anyway later on in the year ?  I assume there are also other updates of other models like the Tucson which is a whole new generation coming late this year maybe ? My pricing I was happy with and since order it has gone up in price in regards to the retail of the rav 4 , but my dealer hasn���t  said I will have to chip in the extra ( as of yet ). I think a few people have been told they will have to cough up a little more. But if you���re not happy with that it gives you an out for the contract. They can���t make you pay the extra so if you don���t want to you can cancel. But I���m pretty sure after a long wait many wouldn���t cancel anyway.
Thanks guys will get back in touch with the dealer they claimed it wasn���t available on the RAV4 originally so a learning experience for them as well by the sound of it.Went into this banking on a 10-12 months wait, only been 3 months next week so plenty of time.Won���t cancel it they���ll release the next model and the same thing will happen so hardly seems worth it.From what I can tell only missing HUD and cooling seats then it would be my ideal car, may tempt me to upgrade but we shall soon see.Edit: I was one of those who has been told I have to pay $350 extra, I got a fairly decent price, annoying having to cough up extra but so be it, limited choices out there from what I can tell.

But what do you do. Picking up mine next week sometime and hasn���t been mentioned yet so must be alll good.
Found it very helpful, knew where the car was from scheduled production through to arrival at the dealer.Though had to go through Toyota Australia and they contacted the dealer directly (as the dealer was pulling the RAV4 isn't on the tracking system card). I was then called by the dealer and somewhat begrudging given the login details.........I made sure I stayed on the phone whilst I tried to login, and the first details given were incorrect........then when I said I guess it's back to Toyota Australia to advise them the system doesn't work the correct logon details were miraculously spotted on their screen and given.....It was all very polite, but you really need to understand what's going on with the bumping etcThanks mate!;-)
Ordered my Cruiser AWD Hybrid end of August and was notified yesterday that my car is finally in production with estimated delivery last week in Feb pending wait time for shipping. That would make it exactly 6 month from day of signing the contract, as advised by many here on the forum
Ordered my Cruiser AWD Hybrid (Saturn Blue with Nutmeg Leather) end of August. Dealer emailed my yesterday that car is in production. Delivery should be end of Feb pending any possible wait time for shipping. That would be exactly 6 month wait period, not 8 or 12 as some post on this forum
Ha Ha I ordered mine in July, they mentioned it was in production December but got a call the other day saying I was bumped to March.
Beermonkeygreen I���m pretty sure we have the exact same schedule,   Which would easily make it over 6 months.
The timing of when seems pretty random. We ordered mid July and have a Jan build for Feb pickup.
Ha Ha I ordered mine in July, they mentioned it was in production December but got a call the other day saying I was bumped to March.I am exactly in the same boat as you although the dealer offered me a 'cancelled' order in November which I declined as I wanted to wait for my 2020 build with the added improvements.

SLedGE writes...What was their response like?Like they didn't really care. My guess is that as I went through a broker I am getting bumped for people that paid a higher price. I can not get online tracking at all for the car they just refuse to provide it which makes me believe there is a reason for that.

not on their radar yet.Of course not yet.Toyota Australia will probably wait (for a while) and see how it goes in OTHER markets before even considering releasing here.I'm assuming Toyota Aus will release the Prime around end of this year or a bit earlier.

Well today I was advised that i've been bumped for the fifth time. Ordered at the start of Sep 2019 with an original prod date of Nov 19. Since then i've been advised that prod has been bumped to Dec, Jan, Feb and now Mar 2020. Getting really sick of it. I'm wondering if my car has been bumped down the queue as its a novated lease :-/
I would have expected March delivery, unsure how they could have given a November delivery considering it was well known when I was ordered back in October to expect a 10-12 month wait although in reality it seems to be more around 6 months as the ball park figure to work with.
Mar 2020 is pretty good considering I ordered mine in July and they���re doing a feb 2020 build for me. Seems like it was too good to be true to be getting a short turnaround.
SeeBee101 writes...Well today I was advised that i've been bumped for the fifth time.Getting really sick of itHave you asked your dealer for the information as mentioned here /thread/3q6qm219?p=56#r1106This will prevent them giving excuses as they could have sold your spot to someone else willing to pay more or is more of a preferred customer etc. If you have that information, especially the VIN, you will then know if Toyota overseas has bumped you, or your dealer messing with you.

I'm wondering if my car has been bumped down the queue as its a novated lease :-/That shouldn't have anything to do with it.The dealership doesn't know what's going on whilst Toyota is trying to sort out this big mess.I ordered my car at the end of July and was initially told November but then was advised that it would be a 2020 build in late October. The dealership found a 'cancelled' order for the same car spec I am after which I appreciated but told them I wanted to wait for my original 2020 order. I was then told the car would probably be built in Jan to be delivered in Feb. Now I get told that the car will be built in March. I am kind of hoping that we get caught in a 'spec change' where they do something like they've now done with the Corolla where you can now get the top half of the car in black (just like the Rav in the UK and USA/Canada).They've given me a 'loan' car which was a brand new Toyota Corolla Hybrid for a fairly reasonable monthly price until my car arrives (this was done as I had a trade-in which was part of the purchase).
SLedGE writes...They've given me a 'loan' car which was a brand new Toyota Corolla Hybrid for a fairly reasonable monthly price until my car arrivesThat's great, how much is the dealer charging you?
I wasn't expecting a November 2019 production date but that's what was advised in the emails from Toyota. When I ordered, I was advised there was a 6 month wait which would have brought me till the end of my current novated lease. Now I have to extend my novated lease for another 6 months which is going to cost me an extra 2k out of my own pocket due to break costs if the car arrives before August 2020.

SLedGE writes...Much less than it would cost to hire a car.That's cool, it's likely the dealer will sell it as a demonstrator when you hand it back, it benefits them as well. Whenever deal they give you, you can bet that they still win in some way or another!
I am going around and around in circles with the dealer, Toyota no help either.According to the sales person the user code isn't available until production has been confirmed, is anyone able to verify whether this is correct?I think just another delay tactic, as far as I am concerned the number should exist whether or not production has been confirmed as an order should have been put through.
bL@De writes...According to the sales person the user code isn't available until production has been confirmed, is anyone able to verify whether this is correct?Referring to the link I posted above, the status will show as On Order/Scheduled for Production or in Production/In Transit to Australia/In Storage Yard/In Transit/Being Prepared for Pick up. So it should at least show 'on order'.Also see /thread/3q6qm219?p=68#r59409987 where the poster said:"I have been told my build date is August with delivery in September.

bL@De writes...Is Peter Kittle actually, have gone back to them,At least different ones seem to be consistent. We ordered July, was told Oct build and now Jan build.

What are people's thoughts on the Edge AWD v cruiser petrol 2WD versions?Seems like there may be petrol engine stock available. or in the very least a much shorter wait time.
weheboy writes...What are people's thoughts on the Edge AWD v cruiser petrol 2WD versionsOne thing for me was the edge misses out on the two person memory seat. And that���s no good for me and the wife. There���s also been reports about a mooing sound when the rear drive disengages ? Or something like that. It may have been rectified but I am unsure.Before I know this I would have bought the edge if it had memory seats. And if they were willing to work harder on the price. We had an edge sitting at my dealer for ages when I ordered my cruiser back in sept.On a side note we had a four month wait for a 2 wd petrol cruiser.

(The USA they're selling almost 70k RAV4s *per month*) but it can mean they want to get more stock out there to sell.eg. the local Toyota dealer near where I was living has a bunch in stock (28 2020 RAV4 hybrids) https://www.toyotaofbellevue.com/searchnew.aspx?Type=N&Year=2020&Make=Toyota&Model=RAV4But it maybe that Toyota want more per dealer for more options.But my point again wasn't about this, it was that Toyota Australia screwed up the ratio of Hybrid to not Hybrid and it's not an actual issue with supply of parts.
This is all academic exercise for me, as I own my RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid 2WD 2019 from early October.She actually gave me a curious hassle today (just about an hour ago).  I was driving slightly uphill  (not much) and, for about a second, the TFT display (where normally the consumption rate number is) the big sign BRAKE (white font on red background) appeared, accompanied by the series of 5 beeps. The car noticeably lost power during that second, and then that BRAKE sign disappeared and the car went back to normal drive.That's what I found at US web site (couldn't find the Australian equivalent of that page):Here's the link ��� may be useful: https://www.toyota.com/owners/resources/dashboard-lights/rav4/2019Quote:-------RAV4-2019-Brake system warning light (warning buzzer) (U.S.A.)Indicates that:The brake fluid level is low or    The brake system is malfunctioningImmediately stop the vehicle in a safe place and contact your Toyota dealer. Continuing to drive the vehicle may be dangerous.This light also comes on when the parking brake is not released. If the light turns off after the parking brake is fully released, the system is operating normally.--------Anyone else had that?

Got confirmation my car had been delivered to dealer and is getting ready for pick up Wednesday. Just got back into to town this arv after being away and and snuck past the dealer and saw it sitting in a shed getting prepped. Have to say I am glad of my eclectic blue colour choice. Had only seen one other in the past 4 months of the same colour and geez it looks nice in the flesh. Been a bit of a wait but getting keen now.
Congrats. You will enjoy the Car.
Quick question.If someone ordered a Hybrid Cruiser (QLD) tomorrow, what is the latest, typical wait time?Anyone ordered in the last month could share?thx
My in laws have the eclectic blue. It's a bit bright for my taste but it's certainly easy to pick them out in a crowd ��� or the Bunnings parking lot.

It might be timely to remind forum members of a collaborative spreadsheet I put together to help Australian RAV4 buyers (especially Hybrid buyers) pool their knowledge and get some sense of waiting times, prices, and the specs we're favouring.Feel free to contribute (or update if you've been by before).https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13uz5pjGx8zZ-VVc2rbo0bf8mQ4kOSEQV1eS2PuoRBAs/edit#gid=0As for me, the online tracker now tells me my 2WD Cruiser Hybrid (Saturn Blue/ Beige interior) ordered 24 July is now scheduled for a late Feb delivery (over 7 months wait).

baliset writes...As for me, the online tracker now tells me my 2WD Cruiser Hybrid (Saturn Blue/ Beige interior) ordered 24 July is now scheduled for a late Feb delivery (over 7 months wait).We ordered almost the same day and have delivery late feb as well. Tracking website for us (when it was up) had given us VIN/Engine number and showed as "In Production". So, fairly confident.
I found the dealer was reliable within the information that they had themselves. The Online Tracker, once it shifts to "Production Scheduled" or whatever the phrase is proved to slightly overstate timeline, so mine tuned up a little faster than I was expecting. Still took six months from order on 1 June 2019

The big BRAKE sign on the lcd display with several beeps means the car has noticed something you may hit. It warns you to brake first then brakes automatically if you don't take action. The smaller brake warning light that will remain illuminated is for a brake system fault. I think you've mistaken one for the other.

Is 41,430 a good price for a Crystal Pearl Rav 4 Cruiser Hybrid 2WD including cargo mat and weathershields? Hoping delivery will be within 4-5 months.
nzcoffeem writes...Is 41,430 a good price for a Crystal Pearl Rav 4 Cruiser Hybrid 2WD includingYou���d assume so going by other prices through this thread. There was also a link to a spreadsheet showing prices paid somewhere in here Considering I paid 41000 for an eclectic blue cruiser in petrol it sounds very good. It was about 2  ish grand more if I recall ? For the hybrid if I wanted it. But we wanted petrol.Looking st Toyota website it is near 46700 so seems cheap.

Yeh the spreadsheet is good. I see someone got an AWD cruiser for 45 with premium paint and others have paid 46-47 for the 2wd cruiser with premium paint.  It���s def up and down.
Okay. So I have to ask. Did a google, searched on here and did a quick scan of the manual. I know it was mentioned on here but what���s the easy way to turn off school zone warnings? Pretty please ??
I understand that there is a long wait for the Hybrid model at the moment, but what about the non-hybrid variants? Are those currently available?Secondly, are those worth looking at or would I be silly to entertain a non-hybrid of this car? I'd be after 2wd petrol car with leather trim.
TheG writes...Secondly, are those worth looking at or would I be silly to entertain a non-hybrid of this car?

Which I think is the first one with ��� leather��� seats. Not sure if the models below it have it. But it took us a four month wait to have our eclectic blue petrol cruiser built. Not sure if they are getting quicker with them. But we literally just got ours yesterday. Obvs the hybrids can be 6 or more months.I think there are a few base model petrols around but not with the leather as you mentioned.
Wazza77 writes...what���s the easy way to turn off school zone warnings?Page 95 in your nav manual. Toggle school zone off.

Anyone contemplating foregoing the hybrid just to get the car delivered quicker should think again.I have been driving a brand new hybrid Corolla until my Rav arrives and I am amazed by the fuel economy.The car is half the cost to run when compared to my old Diesel Fortuner.Your hybrid will return savings to you that will make the wait time insignificant.
I spose it depends on how many kms you travel. We onlyDo around 7000kms a year so with figures of 6.5 L for the petrol compared to 4.7 L of the hybrid it would take me a while to regain my initial investment. Mind you I���m coming from a V8 clubsport so it will be a fair drop for me either way. I also didn���t like the drive of the hybrid for some reason. And it had a weird whine in it when slowing down ? I also liked the 19s on the petrol cruiser compared to the black 18s on the hybrid. But to each their own. As I said if your doing heaps of Kay���s it���s worth the investment.
Wazza77 writes...I also didn���t like the drive of the hybrid for some reason. And it had a weird whine in it when slowing down ?That's the re-gen capturing the charge for the battery.

It was also quite noticeable when the petrol engine kicked in. Not as smooth as I���d presumed. I just prefer th motor running all the time.
There is about a 2.5K difference in price between hybrid and petrol. That will probably take you 120,000km to recoup in saved petrol.

Even if you did twice the km (14,000km), it's still 8.5 years. Given the typical habits of many Australian new car buyers, they would of moved onto another car by then anyway?
You need to factor in that the hybrid will have a better resale price, depending on when you trade it.
Dont get me wrong, I can see why people like it. More power than the petrol and great in stop start traffic being quiet and all.But I have no traffic where I live so not an issue.In regards to  resale my existing car is 17 years old, with just 120, 000 kms on it. But I am keeping it.I assume by the time we ever , if ever get rid of our rav years down the track it may not be a big factor for us either way.Who knows what the future holds.
My local dealership has a Graphite cruiser petrol in stock, but only 1 at the moment. It's obviously not a hybrid but not sure that matters a great deal as the savings aren't astronomical unless you're on the road a lot. What price do you think I should be negotiating towards if we opt for it?
TheG writes...What price do you think I should be negotiating towards if we opt for it?Dunno , someone got a hybrid earlier in the thread for close to 41.000 apparetnyl??But I paid 41 K for my blue cruiser with front tint and carpet matts thrown in.Seemed ok to me at the time but it was back in septemeber. Mine was about 3.5 off the rrp total of car and extras.Have you spoken about price at all to them yet? or feeling it out?
Feeling it outIt's listed at over 44.5k online. Just wonder whether negotiating room is fully compromised given shortage of stock.

This car is a car . Clearance is 8 inches and if you let the tires down this will reduce. Tyres are only road tyres. Bottom of car is flat all over so it could rest on the thick sand deeper than say 6 inches which is not very deep. I would be very careful or say no.
I just (noon on 16/1) spoke to the Toyota Customer Inquiries team. They have confirmed that the customer order tracking portal has been down since the weekend and hope to have the issue resolved before the end of the week.https://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/

For those who have tried the cx-5 and other midsize SUVs, how does this one compare?
Much more spacious seating and boot. Better for taller people.I'm 178cm and found the Mazda a bit cramped.
strangelyemily writes...Much more spacious seating and boot. Better for taller people.I'm 178cm and found the Mazda a bit cramped.I'm the same height as you so that's good to know.Rear cabin and boot space is also important to me with 2 young kids and possibly a 3rd in the future. I was looking at 7 seater cars for this reason, but it sounds like Rav 4 is generously sized for a 5 seater.
TheG writes...Rear cabin and boot space is also important to meYeah ��� I've got a 6'1" 13 year old and RAV4 rear cabin room was what sold it to us over other options.
I'm 6'4" and I can comfortably sit in the rear seat behind my own seating position. The space in this car is what sold it for me as well as the hybrid.I did find the that the moon-roof was going to be a bit of a problem if I was going to step up to the cruiser. The electronic drivers seat would have been nice to have but I didn't want the "leather" seats. But those black rims do look nice!
SLedGE writes...Check dis!https://youtu.be/Vdjb8CrAA6wI've seen that... that doesn't really give you any indication how or performs on sand though.  As far as I can tell, is probably be very wary of taking a rav 4 anything other than a dirt road.
TheG writes...Rear cabin and boot space is also important to me with 2 young kids and possibly a 3rd in the future.

That said I am still waiting so have not got it as yet.
TheG writes...For those who have tried the cx-5 and other midsize SUVs, how does this one compare?regarding height Im 186 ish , and my daughter at 13 is about 173 and still growing. she can sit behind the drivers seat comfortably ( so can I ) with the seat all the way back. Mind you the tucson we cheked was quite good to. But miles apart from the mazda with its sloping roof. In the mazda I could not get the seat to the right position for me. We were looking at the touring in the CX-5, around the same price as the RAV ( at that stage ) , but the electronic seat  did not have the option to "tilt" the  base of the seat back or forward. The actual base I mean. In the rav it does and it gives me just a bit extra leg room when tilted back for me to be comfortable.I was also worried height wise re the sunroof. And after waiting four months i could not rememeber how much head clearance I had, but I can say that is not an issue now I have the car thankfully.From what i can recall boot size looked bigger in the RAV ? but it was a few months ago now. It seemed ample in the mazda but, and fine in the tucson.I liked the hyundai tucson, but with a whole new generation on the way in the not to distant future ( I think the mazda is getting a new gen too) , then it was wait, or buy the rav now. Happy with my choice.
Ever since I got acp  installed. Sometimes when driving slow, less than 15km. The screen doesn't change to front/rear/side  cameras.Anyone have that issue?
Wouldn't surprise me if Toyota pulled down the tracking portal.Think about it?People wanting to see what's going on with no progress??It amazes me that I saw a bunch of new Toyota commercials last night advertising the Rav.9 month wait for a new car is bloody pathetic!

Was chatting with a broker (as I am having issues with the dealer) and he mentioned.���The other thing I have heard out of QLD is that there are quite a few of the RAV4 Hybrids currently at the Port of Brisbane (and potential other ports) where they currently have over 350 hybrids that have been sitting there for a few months. I���m trying to find out more but apparently this might be the case in Sydney also so just trying to see if/when they are being released as they are for Toyota Australia- not allocated to dealers at this stage.���
Test drove the Hybrid base model today. Liked the car and asked the dealer ( FT Gully Toyota) about price, quoted 47k drive away for Hybrid cruiser. He said that he had one available from their allocation and it will be still 4 months��� wait. I asked him if he can do a better price and he said since the cars are in demand there is no room for any discounts. I don���t need a car right now so will wait and see if availability is better in a couple of months��� time. Also, how did some of you guys negotiate and manage to get a better price than RRP? I know someone posted here that they got a Hybrid cruiser around 41k but I find it hard to believe.
Gujju writes...He said that he had one available from their allocation and it will be still 4 months��� waitIf you have to wait 4 months for that one, add 6 ontop of that if you wait for another
Had the chance to quickly take a friend's hybrid for a spin around my suburb today (not 100% sure if it was the 2019 or 2020, I forgot to ask) and I loved every minute of it.Favourite thing by far is 'EV Mode'. I've never driven a Hybrid or EV or anything like that because I frankly can't afford one yet, so turning on the car, reversing out of the carpark and driving off without any engine noise whatsoever was no doubt the weirdest but most amazing first experience I've ever had with a car. It eventually fired up the engine once I got out onto the main road and had to put my foot down a bit to merge, but I was honestly surprised how quickly it seemed to drop down to EV mode when decelerating coming to a red light or just low speed traffic. Didn't have a chance to test out the fuel economy for myself but it's apparently REALLY good.The only thing I found a bit weird was the visibility from the driver's seat. Most of the other SUVs I've test driven (Mazda CX5, Hyundai Santa Fe, et) and even my current 10 year old corolla have much more 'window' to see through at the front. Maybe it's just something I need to get used to.I was originally thinking of making the jump straight to an EV in 1-3 years when I'll be in a position to upgrade from the car I drive now, but the Rav4 hybrid definitely has my attention now.
Would like some feedback on the genuine v  any other dashcam with the RAV4.Have been quoted $580 from the dealer?

Slic writes...Would like some feedback on the genuine v  any other dashcam with the RAV4.Have been quoted $580 from the dealer?Yeh same quote for me. Seems like a pretty good system in regards to what it can do and such. Main thing I like about it is how clean it is plugging straight in in the top sunnie console. Wouldnt even know it���s there. But also would be interested re quality wise and such.I���m still contemplating this. I was hoping they maybe would have worked on the price of the can harder when we were buying the vehicle but to no avail. If it was say around 350-400 I would have done it I reckon. Haven���t had a dash cam but in any other car so not too worried.
My dealer quoted I think it was $1100 to supply / install the BlackVue DR750S-2CH.I ended up grabbing the BlackVue DR900S-2CH yesterday for a smidge over $700 and will install it in the car when it arrives this year.4k is probably overkill but having had 1 in the current car and catching those clowns you get on the road is priceless, some insurers offer a discount as well.
Wouldnt even know it���s there.Thanks for the feedback. I  like the idea of having no wires dangling down.
Speaking of dashcams:Different ppl have different priorities.Mine was (and still is) a good recognition of the number plates in still and motion, day or night.Done a lot of homework, watched tons of comparison videos and the clear winner in this department is Viofo A119v3.  It's also just $160, but the price was not a main factor for me and came as a nice bonus.Absolutely amazing video clarity, even though it's not 4K, but 2560x1600 ��� the new videoprocessor used in this model beats everyone else hands down. Model's released in 2019.It's a single channel cam. If you want dual (front+back), they also just released A129 4K model, but I haven't studied it yet cause I don't neef dual channel.Not trying to sell ��� just adding one more option to consider.

The earth and the sky.Here is one unbiased comparison, for example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdudFMzfE4Convincing, no?NB: Can't comment on the new A129 Duo Pro 4K.
Is there much in the way of a deal/wriggle room on a 2.0 GXL ��� or will I be laughed at?

Hi all.We're looking to buy a 2019 RAV4 ��� either the GX or GXL, 2.0 petrol.  There are two questions we have, that we hope to get some answers on:1.  We know the GX has a full size spare, but the GXL specs show that it only has a space saver.  Our preference is for a full size spare, but would this fit in the GXL spare well space?2.  We've heard some rumblings about the CVT in other manufacturers cars ��� mostly around reliability, performance and maintaining cruising speeds.  Any feedback on the RAV's CVT would be extremely helpful, as we're not sure if this is common on all CVTs or just certain manufacturers.    Note:  we've read great things about the hybrid cruiser, but its a bit out of our budget unfortunately and the wait time doesn't work for our timeframes.Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much!

It's the JATCO sourced boxes (generally Mitsu & Nissan) that give troubles.
Seeing quite a few cruiser hybrids running around now. They look great, chunky and sporty.Is there way at all to tell AWD externally
Is there way at all to tell AWD externallyNo I have a GXL Hybrid and there is no Badge with AWD on it
Hello, excuse my lack of knowledge, I haven't purchased a new car in almost 10 years.My fiancee just ordered a new Edge model, with delivery expected approx. May. When signing the contract (I wasn't there), they had put 200km on the car. She got it down to 100km, which I think is little high for a new car. I understand the car gets test driven at the factory, taken on/off the boat, and driven around the dealership.Just wondering if this normal for a RAV4 delivery?I'm a little worried that when the car arrives, they will use it for test drives as I believe there is only one Edge model floating around the dealers in Perth at the moment.
acollie writes...I'm a little worried that when the car arrives, they will use it for test drives as I believe there is only one Edge model floating around the dealers in Perth at the moment.Check the contract whether they wrote that the car is new/used/demo. There is usually a box where they fill it in around the car details section (model no. etc.). But if you aren't completely convinced with what is written in that box.....Correct me if I'm wrong. I believe to test drive (i.e. demo vehicles) would have to be registered to drive on the road.So if the car you get is newly registered in your/wife's name its 'new'. If the registration is a transfer then its a 'demo' or used.I have never noticed a kilometer notation on a sales contract???
acollie writes...hey had put 200km on the carThis is weird. My RAV4 contract doesn't mention anything like this.When I collected my then-brand-new Mazda from a dealer in 2013, it had only 7 km on its odometer.Maybe they want to use your car for demo purposes for a little while?
Thanks for the replies weheboy and Larry R.weheboy writes...I have never noticed a kilometer notation on a sales contract???The contract states 'New'. The kms is in the 'conditions' box at the bottom, basically where you put things like expected delivery, subject to trade, etc conditions. I will double check the paperwork when I get home though because there was another form she had which I think had something to do with registration.Larry R writes...Maybe they want to use your car for demo purposes for a little while?Yeah this is what I'm concerned about. She is very particular and won't even let me drive the car for a while (understandably) so she will be very upset if it is used as a demo.

Perhaps ignorance is bliss? hahaShe was happy to sign the contract with that km arrangement. So unless someone mentions something to concern her, I would imagine she would be equally fine/happy when picking up the car.. ?I also do not like the idea of a demo car, but also acknowledge that mechanically/visually it probably won't make a measurable/noticeable difference. Particularly if they do the car delivery prep well.

you can expect 10km on a new car ... 200 is quite excessive.
Just wondering, when buying a new car they charge a pre delivery fee for new cars.At what point or kms does this not apply.Example 10 kms yes still new, 200kms means it being driven so it will already be pre delivered no extra charge.Looking for feed back.
when buying a new car, you negotiate the terms, its better if the car is already available because then you can see the car and the details.i've bought 2 new cars in the past year, i just negotiate exactly how the car will be and both times they have been as i've expected.  i negotiate to the drive away price, i dont really care how they split that up on their end.

A new car should not have those kms.But if the contract was signed with a special condition that there would be up to 100km on the clock and it was noted in the original question that it was already negotiated down from 200km to 100km (i.e. it was a clause that was discussed not just sneaked in) ... then unless the dealer is nice about it doubt there is any leverage to renegotiate it bar forfeiting a deposit.......?
The new cruiser on the lot I looked at initially had 80kms on it. Assumed it had been used a bit like a demo?But the one we ordered we just made sure we picked it up as soon as possiible of it being ready ( to not give others the chance to sit in it/ look around or mark it. It had 9 Kms on it. they go it sunday on the truck , was ready tuesday lunch with tint.As we have no other cruisers on the lot locally i didn't want to give them reason to be using mine for demo.On a side note am digging the car. Looking forward to good road trip in april. The lane keep assist takes a bit to get used to! Weird bloody feeling. The 2 litre is no powerhouse by any means but keeps itself poking along just fine. And will be more than capable running up the highway with the dual lanes and such. not as big a concern to have a big heap of horsepower under the bonnet.

Any feedback on the RAV's CVT would be extremely helpful, as we're not sure if this is common on all CVTs or just certain manufacturersNot sure regarding reliability as such with the car only being new. But driveability wise its my first CVT and all I heard waspeople bagging them out . I was slightly concerned but to no avail. Its fine , smooth and actually for me more enjoyable than a normal auto. No rough gear change, just a smooth constant acceleration until I reach my speed. Im really not sure what all the fuss is about with the CVTs ( unless they are crap ones that break down), but I fine it quite nice to drive. Keeping speed is fine, on the open road set the radar cruise and you're laughing.
I directly asked my dealer NOT to use my car for any demo when it arrives (I picked it up from him in October), and he said that it is actually illegal for them to do that, if the car is sold as new, not xdemo. Mine had 7km.I suspect those 200km are the result of some kind of "cost cutting" exercise (for example, driving it to the dealership rather than getting it towed to there) rather than intended demo/testdrive usage.  Too high of a risk for them.

Didn���t worry me as I was happy with initial price. Also there had been a price rise on the vehicle since then ( which going by my contract they could have asked me to pay , or me cancel the contract ) but I obvs didn���t have to pay it. I���m happy overall. I���ll be keeping the car for donks so it won���t be a concern down the track.  No doubt there are quite a few in the same boat. Hey, I���m just happy to have the car after the wait !
GiveItaWhirl writes...Mine had 6km on it.I bought a new Rav4 just before Christmas and had the same as you. I thought the dealer must have someway of resetting the odometer. As I am sure the car must have been driven more than that. Even getting off the ship to the holding yard. Holding yard to dealer etc all would have been more km than what was shown.
graduateman writes...Build date 2019 Dec, Compliance Jan 2020. Should I negotiate lower price? Paid initial deposit long time ago.They will probably cancel your order and sell to someone else.

Used to see some with as low as 3km in the delivery bay, others 10-14kms depending on how many movements they had been through before being ready for their new owner.

We ordered a cruiser hybrid late November but we are a bit concerned how the black alloy wheels are standing up to normal wear and tear. Dealer is quite happy to swap them for the uncoated alloys, apparently they are the same rim and tyre, We would be very interested to hear about the experience of those who are lucky enough to have had their cruisers for a while.
Hi, Can you get a deal for RAV4 in NSW, drive/transport it to ACT and pay no stamp duty in ACT (for hybrid) ? Or do you need to pay it first in NSW and then get reimbursed ? In ACT dealers are trying to increase prices by 3% and if you don't know. it looks they are matching deals from other states.
@BCMSI have on problems with the black rims.Got my Cruiser in August and have done 5 trips to Rockhampton on the back roads from Ipswich. Done 9500km so far.
for insurance , now have  AXAH52R , 54R ?? MXAA52R  ... What's the difference , also have NAV model ?? ( is NAV standard now  ??)

I purchased a car from QLD, had it sent down by train to SA, simply got a 1 day temp permit in SA to say what roads I would be using / date / time and purpose ie driving to get car registered.I never paid stamp duty in QLD but had to pay it in SA when the car was registered.
BCMS writes...concerned how the black alloy wheels are standing up to normal wear and tearI have had my car since September and driven 6000 kms on all sorts of road. Nil issues thus far. I understand that the alloy one costs less than the black one. Could that be why the dealer is happy to swap them.?Personally I think the black one looks great on the cruiser hybrid.
Spot on me too, I went black so black rims and dark tint should look pretty smick.I don't understand how black rims vs another colour could have more 'wear and tear'? If anything I would prefer them on the basis you won't see it when they get dirty from road grime or brake pad dust.
I can say this as my wife doesn���t read these posts but what I was thinking of with wear and tear was scuffing the odd curb or two and removing the black coating!  The dealer gave me the impression that it was no hassle for them to change the rims, certainly made no mention one was more expensive than the other.
Anyone purchased a 2wd Cruiser Hybrid in Melb recently? Looking to get some pricing and find out which dealer is easiest to deal with

People need to stop backing Toyota here.Yes the RAV4 is a good car, but the fact the the matter is the US and other markets don't have a waiting list like here.Toyota Australia need to be held accountable.. Initial order of 40% Hybrid on their part  was a big mistake.Just like their call of RAV4 PHEV, that is wrong too, or a basic lie because they don't want cancellations of normal Hybrid, so will release in next year or after.

Initial order of 40% Hybrid on their part  was a big mistake.Australia is a tiny market. We are not prioritised in terms of delivery numbers by Toyota in terms of the global market. The US is.The Rav 4 won Carsguide car of the year in 2019. Clearly people like the car and are willing to wait.This is a really weird position to suggest that people who want a Rav 4 should hold Toyota accountable by not ordering a Rav 4, even if that is the car they want and they are prepared to wait. Or that they should cancel their order now and get something else (and presumably forfeit their $1k deposit).Your point about the car being somewhat obsolete due the waiting time makes no sense. You aren't waiting 6-9 months for a car that had already been built when you ordered it. You are waiting for them to build the car. You will receive the latest spec model that is being constructed at a time. If you ordered in September 2019 for example and the car is delivered in the middle of 2020 you are receiving a 2020 car.
Braveheart81 writes...This is a really weird position to suggest that people who want a Rav 4 should hold Toyota accountable by not ordering a Rav 4Doesn't seem like a good strategy for Toyota to sell new vehicles if  they are clearly unable to meet consumer demand (regardless of market).  You could say they're a victim of their own success ��� just really not expected of Toyota.Are we seeing comparable delivery times for corollas and camrys?  Is there a worldwide shortage of batteries for hybrid camrys?  Toyota seem to have really dropped the ball on this one.
There was an 8 month waiting list well before drive or anyone made it car of the year.By the time you buy the car and receive it, Toyota will be soo much closer to releasing an updated car, like the PHEV.

TheG writes...Wouldn't budge on sticker price at 47k but threw in tank of fuel and carpet mats.Well done! i spoke to three dealers in Sydney and none would budge on RRP.. I got a few extras thrown in ��� well worth to have the car immediately.
Thanks all.@gujju it was a dealer in VICMy old car was toast so I've been borrowing my parents second car in the meantime. The thought of a 6+ month wait and having to hold on to it during that time and inconvenience them further wasn't really an option either of us wanted.

Oh wow, so there are now RAV4 fleecers around, well done Toyota Australia!
I just talked to the Toyota dealer in ACT and he said that there is a 12 months wait for a Hybrid Cruiser. He claims that the delay is the same in all major cities. Are they for real ? Some people here claimed that they bought in early January with delivery in July. Are the dealers trying to suck you in and then delay ?
Really comes down to a guessing game, sounds as though Toyota is ramping up production.I think fair to say in most cases expect 6 months approximately but delivery times are all over the place, you have people here claiming to order in December and getting next month yet those poor sods who ordered in July are still waiting.

That would seem a comparable pick to the AWD Cruiser which is under $50k.I have no doubts the Volvo would be a nicer car to own but that's a fair chunk of change.

What price have you guys been quoted for a tow bar installed on the Cruiser AWD Hybrid? Debating whether I go genuine or aftermarket.
bL@De: Genuine Toyota one was $1200 installed.
Cheers EQUIPED, actually a little cheaper than I was expecting.
Just filled up for second time so starting to see plausible long term figures. This tank, I ran until the distance to empty read 2km, before filling up at usual service station. I filled the tank until the pump switched off automatically and did not seek to top it out (an aside that, as you fill, the tank vent whistles, with quire a loud noise if your are standing behind the filler spout, barely noticeable if standing toward front of car).840.01 km from 46.00 l.  so an average of 5.5 l/100 km over a mix of city, highway and suburban driving. The first tank was 5.9 l/100km so I am pretty happyThe fill of 46.00 l implies 9.0 l remains in the tank, when the Distance to Empty is reading as Zero, implying a range of about 160km remaining in the tank for an emergency reserve, albeit, it is not great to run the tank to empty.
grahampeters writes...implying a range of about 160km remaining in the tank for an emergency reserve, albeit, it is not great to run the tank to empty.10L is the reserve capacity in most Japanese cars. So your observation is accurate.Running the tank dry is supposedly bad for the pump, which relies on being in fuel for cooling.But feel free to experiment all you like with both the 160 Km and what happens to the pump in an empty tank. lolEdit: My experience with a new car is that the economy goes up as the engine loosens up, then goes down as you use the performance more.But the numbers you quote are admirable.
any one know any sydney dealers that have a hybrid GX model as a test drive vehicle? (preferably 2WD..i dont see the point of a AWD vehicle for the suburbs.)
I had a test drive with a RAV4 AWD Cruiser Hybrid today.  I had only 15 mins because of high demand for test drives but it looked somehow sluggish to me. It felt a bit heavy and underpowered. I have a Camry Hybrid and always liked its instant torque and response. They should have similar engines and weights, right ? Maybe I need to go for another test drive to try it better but I expected more power. The dealer confirmed a 12 month waiting time and didn't even ask for my contact details.  i was ready to buy but now I am not so convinced.
yeah thats what i have a concern about.. the GX hybrid 2WD weights at 1650kg..so hence i want to test drive one to see how sluggies it might be.the normal gx i had a look at seemed ok.. it does sort of feel a little bit "cheapish" on the inside compared to a mazda....one thing i found disappointing is the rear seats dont "slide" forwards/backwards. you'd think spending so much money on the car it would have that as standard.

InternalBleeding writes...one thing i found disappointing is the rear seats dont "slideWhat for? You've got over 550L in the back and then to add more weight to the seats? Mind you the hybrid battery is under the seat so the seat base would have to be raised (see CRV 7 seater vs 5 seater) to accomodate a sliding mechanism or the hybrid battery take up the spare tyre well (no spare tyre/spare tyre angled in with higher load lip/reduced cargo space) or centre console (no deep storage centre console).TL;DR. Accomodating rear sliding seats impacts more things more people care about.
OK, so it looks like from order to "delivery" that my Cruiser AWD will be a 6 months wait according to a fairly useless email from the sales guy. Let's see in April how that turns out.
SmellyTofu writes...What for?sometimes its handy when you have to fit something bigger and you need to move the back seat up/forward to fit it in.i found it very useful when i used to have a older CRV.
InternalBleeding writes...i found it very useful when i used to have a older CRV.I don���t think there is a lot of cars on the market that have moveable rear seats
It was there in the 2nd generation where it would slide and be removable in a 50:50 configuration but had the benefit of no hybrid battery and spare tyre on the back door.
what i found interesting and bad customer service is toyota dealers...went to two different dealers and both really didn't care about assisting me.they know very well these cars are selling like hotcakes and they just don't care.while i was waiting in the lot, one came back from a test drive and straight away the person said...yep well buy it..and the higher model too.another dealer didn't even bother calling me back.i guess other manufacturers have really underestimated the market of people wanting a hybrid/electric SUV. Good on you Toyota i guess.
To sell Toyota���s competition will need to sell on price.  Toyota���s rivals have been caught flat footed.  If you want a cheap car, best avoid a hybrid for now.

As best as I can figure out, just before the beginning of each month they schedule the next month's production. Mine went from order to scheduled at the very end of December. Then from scheduled to in production on 23rd, had VIN and engine number 24hrs later.
I ordered mine in July, and said February was as long as I could wait to my dealer. I was supposed to be getting my car in December. Does anyone have an idea on how the schedule works if it were to go into production next month? When would I likely have the car?
needanewname19 writes...Does anyone have an idea on how the schedule works if it were to go into production next month?

Ordered in June and was told delivery will be mid Feb. Which relates to an 8 month wait.. intially told 3 lol
Mine is now on a ship (ordered Dec) yay!I was trying to work out what ship it would be on without much luck.
Does anyone have an idea on how the schedule works if it were to go into production next month? When would I likely have the car?I have exactly the same question. My RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid has been on order since July 24.The portal currently says "Latest Estimated Pick Up Date: 25/02/2020", which I don't trust for a minute, because it also still says only "Scheduled for production".If  it takes a month door-to-door from production to dealer, and they haven't even made my car, I can't imagine how they're going to meet that delivery date.If you've used the portal and have your Toyota, how quickly did your car arrive once the status went to "In Production"?This has been an unmitigated clusterf**k from Toyota. Absolutely rotten customer service. I'm sure the car will be brilliant, but the way they've handled these delays has been awful.
gmawun writes...Ordered in June and was told delivery will be mid Feb. Which relates to an 8 month wait.. intially told 3 lolWhoever told you 3 months has deliberately misled you and was not following Toyota's official notice ��� which is that the RAV4 Hybrid is a 7-9 month wait.If any dealerships are saying anything otherwise, they are angling for sales by "trying to get you one earlier" or artificially creating demand saying they are a 12 month wait at the momentsure things can go wrong and there will be some variance, but +95% of cars will be delivered in that timeframe.
Whoever told you 3 months has deliberately misled you and was not following Toyota's official notice ��� which is that the RAV4 Hybrid is a 7-9 month wait...Except that isn't what Toyota has said at all.When responding to reports of delays caused by a sales-stop back in July, Toyota refused to tell CarSales.com.au about delays at all:However, it won���t say what kind of delays customers should expect for delivery of 2169 Camry, Corolla, Prius and RAV4 hybrid vehicles produced between April and May this year, the majority of which were checked and released after being "found to be consistent with Toyota���s manufacturing standards".Then, in October, CarsGuide.com.au finally got an admission delays were much worse:The wait time for the top-spec Cruiser hybrid RAV4 ��� which won our mid-sized AWD SUV comparison earlier in 2019 ��� is now at "about six months".By early December, CarAdvice.com.au  reported:However, a statement from Toyota Australia issued to CarAdvice this week said: ���The supply outlook for hybrid is good, and in most cases is what we would define as a reasonable wait time of three to four months���.The one exception is the delay on Toyota RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid ���which could be up to six months���.However, Toyota added ���the supply outlook for the first few months of next year is very strong, so these waiting times are likely to reduce. (The RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid) may have a six-month wait for now, but that could come back to three or four months as supply improves early next year���.Ironically, in the same week in December, whichcar.com.au were being told:Such is the demand for the RAV4 Cruiser hybrid that, at its peak, customers were told that they wouldn���t receive their vehicles for eight months after signing on the dotted line.Speaking with Wheels, Toyota Australia Vice President Sales and Marketing, Sean Hanley, said that waiting times are reducing and that everything is being done to aid supply as quickly as possible.���It was at a peak of around eight months, and by the end of the year that���ll drop down to six months.The upshot being is that people who bought in June and July (like me) were most definitely told the wait would be 3-4 months. Toyota denied for months the delays would be worse, and it took until October for them to change to "6 months tops" in public statements, even though their Vice President immediately contradicted it by admitted to up to 8 months.Personally, I'm convinced that if they've lied consistently, then they're lying now as well. If you're contemplating buying a RAV4 (which I'm sure is a great car), do not trust Toyota as far as you can spit them over the likely wait.And that, simply, is not good enough.
baliset writes......Except that isn't what Toyota said at all.Not disputing what they have said publically but this is all PR.Im just looking to share the facts ��� and the facts are the current notice from Toyota AU to the dealer network is 7-9 months even as of now (last notice was Jan 1). We deal with them every day so I'd trust this info over any press statementThe upshot being is that people who bought in June and July were most definitely told the wait would be 3-4 months. Toyota denied for months the delays would be worse, and it took until October for them to change to "6 months tops" in public statements.If thats what they have said pubically then they should withdraw or update that, as the current leadtimes are certainly not 6 months tops
the current notice from Toyota AU to the dealer network is 7-9 months even as of now (last notice was Jan 1)So Toyota PR says that increased supply will reduce the wait in the new year to 3-4 months, while dealers are being told 7-9? No wonder people are confused.
I ordered in July and got it in November. I made it sure that the contract said delivery by end of Novemberand it just made it. Make the dealer responsible for there promises.

The expected wait times have gone up and down over time.It isn't a lot of evidence but based on the Rav 4 google sheet, it would seem a lot of people who ordered in the middle of 2019 were told ranges of 5-12 months for delivery. It certainly doesn't seem like many were told less than three months at that point.

Hi WrrrHad the car for 6 months now. The lowest I had was 5.4L/100. My highest was 6.8L/100. My average is about 5.8L/100km.Hybrid Cruiser AWD.
bL@De writes...Rubbish, I got a fairly decent discount and not had a single delay...yet and is scheduled for next month production, much better than the 10-12 months that was being very much flaunted at the time.Tend to agree here, many sold at discounts and some have come earlier than expected.From what ive seen fleet orders are the only ones with relatively consistent proritisation
Second tank in an AWD Cruiser on mixed travel was slightly below 5.5l/100km. Notably, the more stop-start city driving I do, the better the economy, which seems really strange.
My AWD Cruiser has done about 1600 km. Mainly been doing suburban driving and the occasional freeway trip on cruise control. My last tank was 5.3 L/100 km.I'm really impressed by the economy on the freeway.  On a recent return journey between S.E. Melbourne and Geelong (220 km) it was 5.0 L/100 km according to the trip computer. I just left it on adaptive cruise control the entire way. It takes some getting used to, especially when there's a few drivers who like to weave in and out of traffic. At least I regen some electrical power when the system slows me down to let them in.......

Details on the contract confirm its a Jan 2020 production and Jan 2020 compliance.  I signed the contract and placed the order last Friday (so one week ago) and from what the dealer said, I was pretty lucky to get this one as it was one of the last ones unallocated in this colour in this shipment.   Other quotes I received had a wait time of 4 months!  That's for silver sky by the way.
German Hotrod writes...So um......your vehicle hasn't even been delivered?Like many others no but I have every reason to believe it will happen sooner rather than later.Has gone through the following motions from what I can tell on the portal:12/10/19 ��� 9/1/2020 ��� On order ��� Still to be confirmed21/1/20 ��� On Order ��� February 202029/1/20 ��� Scheduled for production ��� February 202030/1/20 ��� Scheduled for production ��� Latest Estimated Pick Up Date 06/04/2020Whereas I think others are getting phone calls / emails about it being delayed another month, I haven't spoken to the dealer since early December about the price being pushed up $350 I think it was.
I see there is a lot of discussion about delivery times. I will try to explain a very complex process as simply as I can.Dealer supply works on an allocation system based on TMCA���s forward order. That annual order is done 12 months in advance. The annual volume rarely changes; all that can be done is adjust when it is manufactured.  ie delayed or brought forward. The mix of model, grade & factory options are firmed up about 3 months before production, colour and trim is confirmed at time of production order. TMCA only orders once a month for delivery in 2 month���s time. A dealer���s fair share of the allocation is earned by a complex formula. Some small country dealer may only earn one every 2 months whereas a major metro dealer may earn 30 a month. The number of retail orders a dealer has, has little impact on the volume supply to a dealer but may affect the mix. That is why it is hard for a dealer to predict when they will get a vehicle in the specification you want. Hybrid sales historically have been in the range of 20-40%  of a model line. And therefore I suggest that TMCA when they did their production plan for 2019 (in the middle of 2018) they ordered 40% RAV4 as hybrid. History now says the demand is in the 60-75% range. That is why the delivery time is so hard to predict. Soon 2020 production will start to flow and I suggest that TMCA have upped the 2020 annual order mix of hybrid���s to match the demand. This is assuming TMC has the capacity to build more. For lots of reasons the vehicle tracking system is only of benefit once a dealer has a confirmed production vehicle allocated to them and a retail order from you that matches the specification exactly. (Vehicle tracking wasn���t designed to work in WA). At the end of the day they are a great vehicle and worth the wait.
What a load of crap. Fleet orders are not prioritised. If anything, its been the opposite.Ordered in early Sep19 and have been told every month that the planned prod date has moved. It now sits at Mar 2020 which I won't hold my breath for.I've now had to extend my current lease for another 6 months as my lease expires at the start of Feb 2020.

Anyone think the RAV4 PHEV will make its way here this year to compete with the Ford Escape PHEV?
Does anyone know if the tow bar option is installed at factory or at the dealer? I am still thinking whether to add the tow bar considering it is a 2wd hybrid I ordered. If it has to be ordered from the factory, it would mean I have to make the decision now.

nzcoffeem writes...Does anyone know if the tow bar option is installed at factory or at the dealer?Accessories are done at the dealer during pre-delivery.
Awesome. Thank you Graham121 and Cloudripper.Out of curiosity. Do you think TMC deliberately underrated the towing capacity of the 2WD hybrid?What I dont get is why a 2.5L Hybrid gets less towing power than the 2L petrol variant. And how does the AWD Hybrid have 3x the towing capacity when it only generates slightly more power.I am no expert but something seems to not add up. It is like they wanted something to differentiate between the 2WD and AWD.
Just got confirmation from my dealer that I should be able to pick up the car mid march which is inline with my tracking. Here's hoping its all true!
PradopeteNice clear explanation of the order process. Thanks.My own experience through a large city dealer was pretty straightforward, but still took six months. I bought as a Fleet Customer  and there was no obvious difference in delivery time. In fact the fleet sales guy commented that I was in an unusual position as most fleet buyers have a required delivery date and hence he was seeing a lot of fleet buyers transfer their order from hybrids to petrol to match lease roll-over dates. Accordingly, private buyers were getting more reliable delivery than fleet buyers for hybrids.

German Hotrod writes...Toyota is prioritising those whom have paid Toyota's full $RRP! over and above those whom had received dealers incentive to purchase the current shape RAV4 at a discounted rate!,Toyota head office have absolutely no idea how much anyone pays for any vehicle when a dealer and the customer (guest ) agree on a price. They do get figures from the dealers during the month after vehicles are delivered to the new owner for comparison purposes, but that in no way impacts any delivery time.As Pradopete mentioned earlier, Toyota Australia has an allocated build quantity each month which it then distributes out the dealer network with each dealer receiving its allocation for that months production based on a very complex algorithm. Sold cars are allocated first, followed by vehicle the dealers have ordered for their own stock, though if a dealer has more sold cars waiting production than allocated build slots these will be carried over to the following month.An individual dealer may choose to swap customers over at this point at their discretion.
Larry R writes...This is simply not true!

German Hotrod writes...So what you're saying is that Toyota would have absolutely no idea to the contents of what a consumers contract contains with one of it's branded franchised dealers?Absolutely, and that is one of the fundamental differences between the independent franchised dealer model, as operating here in Australia and the agency model that operates in some other countries, ie Toyota in New Zealand recently adopted that model.

I wouldn't be so sure. I was advised just before Christmas (ordered in September) that it may take between 9-12 months to get my car. Still haven't heard a peep about a confirmed prod date...

SeeBee101 writes...I wouldn't be so sure. I was advised just before Christmas (ordered in September) that it may take between 9-12 months to get my car. Still haven't heard a peep about a confirmed prod date...They are being conservative which is probably the right thing to do so as not to disappoint customers, as to be honest they have no idea until well after the order is placed.  Most have been between 6-9 months ��� it all depends on production volumes at the time of order and what colour you choose vs how many of that colour are produced in that given month etc.
Hifi writes...They are being conservative which is probably the right thing to do so as not to disappoint customersYou just need to look at this thread for evidence of people being told 3 months and having to wait double that. I bet having a 12 month window for delivery also means a lot of buyers can't jump ship and get their deposit back if something better catches their eye.
I am really hoping that whilst we're waiting that Toyota adds the color option to have the top half of the car painted black like they do in the US and UK.Then I will change my order or tell them to shove it if they don't allow me to change it.

Somethingnew writes...in merc it limits the speed when you are driving with foot on accelerator (not in cruise control mode)I can't speak on behalf of what  a Merc does but I think the Mazda makes the accelerator have more resistance if you're going at 80 and the limit is 80... so you can decide to go above the set limit if you desire. I wouldn't feel too comfortable having it on if the computer can devoid me of any functionality in case it's needed for whatever reason.
Somethingnew writes...in merc it limits the speed when you are driving with foot on accelerator (not in cruise control mode)The one in the Aus RAV4 just prompts you to change your speed when you're in cruise control mode. The intelligent speed assistance thing is a new European regulation so that's probably why its in the German cars and the UK variant. Personally I hate the idea of it, but it'll probably come to Australia at some point in the future.

Will be happy to be proven wrong ��� please refer me to the page of the Owner's Manual that tells me how to snap the setpoint to the recognised speed limit.
I ordered a Silver Sky GXL AWD Hybrid on 11th of Jan, got an SMS yesterday from the dealer saying it's on a boat, should be ready for pickup around the end of the month. A lot quicker than I expected! Now i'm sure the cruiser waitlist is longer but surely not 12 months...For all interested I paid $47k with Roof racks, tow bar, cargo mat, rubber floor mats, window tint and their paint protection, in SA.
For tinting try Protint at Salisbury, have heard only good things about them and will be getting mine done when the car arrives, pretty sure the suggestion came from here actually.$330 for darkest legal which was a fraction of what the dealer wanted to sell me with the rubbish spin it was cancer council approved.Dare say a few cancellations would be popping up especially the initial waiting times quoted then within 6 months of the release wait times were led to be 10-12 months which spot on doesn't seem to be the case at all for I'd imagine 90% of cases.

Wazza77 writes...Is yours the cruiser with privacy tint and only needing the fronts tinted?or do you need all the car tinted?Actually not too sure, I just asked them how much to tint the car, our tinting laws changed a few years back so we can get 20% on the rears with 35% on the drivers and passenger side front.Dealer quoted $695 as a matter of interest which is miles away to what you had been quoted.

digital_silence said ..I tried this many times on my Cruiser. Will be happy to be proven wrongYou are Wrong . I have a GXL AWD Hybrid and a long press on the up or down sets the auto pilot to  speed as read on sign.I then add about 2 Ks because the cruise is set at the speedo speed and not GPS speed. The speed sign on the dash goes red as it thinks you are speeding but the Nav GPS speed stays white because you are not speeding. I've had my car 2 months now and that is how I  use it
bL@De writes...Actually not too sure,I think from memory you're getting the cruiser? so obviously it comes with privacy glass ( tint from back windows to rear ) , and will only need the fronts tinted. If they quoted 695 for just that its crazy ( just to clarify this wasnt just for fronts?). I read of a few people quoted around the 270-290 mark for the front tint from dealer.The rear tint on them is very dark from factory, and my fronts are dark ( tinted at dealer still darker than I thought would of been possible ).

Brian McGee writes...$290 for tinting the front appears very reasonable ��� is this privacy glass or a film tint? Do you know if this is done by Toyota or if it's outsourced to a nearby tinter?HI mate, yeah i got the impression  it may have been towards $200 if done by a local mob, ( from previous research )But i was happy with getting it done for a bit more at dealer and having it ready at pick up.my tint was done at the local dealer in house, the bloke who preps the cars used to have his own tint / detail shop, so he does this while getting the vehicle ready.Its film tint i assume. Not sure if other dealers outsource or do on ��� site though.
bL@De writes...Will find out in a couple of months when I head to the tint place.Might be worth a bit of a look into before the car rocks up. Clarify with the tinter you were thinking of, and also with your local dealer.It is only the fronts you need doing ( as the cruiser has the privacy glass) so either way it would be under 300, as I said I paid 270 at dealer price. Probs more thana specialized tinter but easier having it done for pick up.
bL@De writes...This remains a mystery though I didn't even think to ask at the time as to whether that was ~$350 per window or for the whole lot, for that price you would think the whole lot.It would be unusual for a tinting place to quote per window, I think they would quote for the whole job.
Brian McGee writes...It would be unusual for a tinting place to quote per window,Sorry to clarify I was basing it off $695 for the dealer so round figures $350 per window assuming only 2 windows.Wazza77 writes...Might be worth a bit of a look into before the car rocks up. Clarify with the tinter you were thinking of,and also with your local dealer.Exactly my thoughts, have seen a few running around with just the privacy glass and then some which appear to have tint over the top.Much easier to have it all done pre-delivery but $695 is a bit pricey for the convenience factor.
bL@De writes...Much easier to have it all done pre-delivery but $695 is a bit pricey for the convenience factor.Sorry mate. I mean check with the dealer. They may have quoted for all windows. I only paid 270 for the two fronts(total )  as that���s all that needs doing in the cruiser. If you get what I mean. The privacy glass is rear tinted windows but done from factory.
rroland writes...You are Wrong . I have a GXL AWD Hybrid and a long press on the up or down sets the auto pilot to  speed as read on sign.I then add about 2 Ks because the cruise is set at the speedo speed and not GPS speed. The speed sign on the dash goes red as it thinks you are speeding but the Nav GPS speed stays white because you are not speeding. I've had my car 2 months now and that is how I  use itI was wrong indeed. Following the advice by Somethingnew, I did a bit of RTFM. You have to specifically enable DRCC (RSA) ��� Dynamic Radar Cruise Control with Road Sign Assist ��� from the settings menu to be able to do what you described. My cruiser came with that feature disabled by default, and that's why I couldn't set the road sign speed by the long press. Did you specifically enable that mode in your car via menu (Pg. 77 of the manual linked above) or it came with it turned on already?

Does everyone think there is a bit more wiggle room with regards to pricing now or still difficult to negotiate?

Advised around a 6 month wait, with the standard clause that if it takes longer than stipulated I can walk away.
There are a lot of accessories in that list, and the nudge bar and roof racks are especially expensive. I doubt you could do much better
jimbok writes...All for $44,500I am interested in the same car. I would have signed up on the spot had I been offered that price!
LOL writes...In the GXL is there a way to automatically retract mirrors when you lock doors?Or do you need to press the button each time?Not only that. The car engine has to be on for that button to work.Once you switched off the engine, you can not fold/unfold them, which is ridiculous.Many-many pages ago in this thread, I asked the RAV4 2019 owners to make their official complaints to Toyota wrt the absence of the auto-folding mirrors feature. Mind you, this feature is present in UK model, so Toyota obviously thought about it.  I spoke to Toyota Au about this, as I see it to be a safety issue (search my posts in this thread by the word "mirrors" if you want to see why), and Toyota said that if they had enough feedback from the customers, they would consider adding this into the future firmware upgrades.So, please consider lodging you formal complaint with Toyota re those mirrors ��� they have a web form on their site to do that.I also looked at the aftermarket kits to add this feature, but we have to be careful as doing that might affect the warranty.

Wazza77 writes...But I also like the fact of how clean the install is with no wires visible, as the power source comes from inside the top light console near the rear view mirror.That's true but you can buy an aftermarket camera and get it professionally installed to be like that. You can also get rear cameras as well. I paid about $150 in labour for a car audio tech's time to do it for me.
Brian McGee writes...That's true but you can buy an aftermarket camera and get it professionally installed to be like that.Peter Kittle here was selling the BlackVue units (was the DR750S going on the brochure I got), was expecting the Toyota branded one but nope.
I daresay the Blackvue will be far superior to Toyota's OEM one. The Blackvue is a quality product, I own the DR950S myself and will probably get another for my new RAV4.
Brian McGee writes...That's true but you can buy an aftermarket camera and get it professionally installed to be like thatwell thats ok then. i havent had any experience re cameras so as long as it was tidy and no cords running down or across the top of the windscreen to be powered somewhere else would be ok.I spose other models can power from the top console ? i just liked how tidy the toyota unit was. In saying that I didne get a dashcam. Havent had one in any car as of yet. I may think about it down the track but I havent had any big worry/thought to need one.

I had put a deposit today on GX 2wd Hybrid white colour and quote was $ 36,800 including mats (minus navigation).not much discount happening on hybrid models.delivery quoted: April built may delivery.
Braking when someone cuts in is usually pretty well modulated. I had a "BMW on Green P's" do that to me last night (in the course of 10 lane changes in about 2km to get one car length ahead) and the Radar Cruise backed off, but did not brake hard.

Even the lexus es 300h hybrid has the growl of the petrol kicking in. Also the regenerative braking on hybrids can result in quite high revs while the car slows.

Carsguide did a podcast a few days ago where they interviewed him.Nope. Toyota said this two months ago on CarAdvice.com.au and nothing has changed.If you follow the Aus fb page you���ll see there are no reports at all of deliveries speeding up. If anything it���s getting worse.My hybrid cruiser has been on order since September and just last week was bumped from Feb production to March. There are no signs at all of deliveries speeding up.
Brian McGee writes...Also, it appears as though you ordered in July last year and still haven't gotten it yet. I'd escalate to Toyota HQ if I were you, that's past the realm of absurditiy.It���s not past the realm of absurdity. If you go on the Aus FB page you���ll see the June/July orders are just now arriving. One guy did get his awd cruiser in six months which is the best I���ve seen. For most it���s 7-8 months as a realistic time for cruisers at this stage.GX and GXL models are shorter waits as well as petrol. And some people are snagging cancellations.

As I said, he said six months if you order now and speeding up to four months in the next few months.
I ordered my AWD Cruiser (Crystal Pearl) on 30th October and have firm delivery date of 4th March, so a little over 4 months.  The dealer did say that some colours are impossible for them to get at the moment, being black and dark blue.
Similar timing to us, and exactly the same car. We���re expecting ours at the end of March. Clearly they are starting to increase their deliveries. This was all before it won all the awards but
Same again. 29th Sept order. Delivery scheduled for the 10th March. Crystal Pearl AWD Cruiser. I was told 9-12 months by the dealer when I ordered. Other dealers that same day said 12 months. I said to the sales guy I bought through was it a case of under promise & over deliver and he said yes, most likely 6 months but we���ll have the contract state 9 which we were ok with. No tracking at my end, but I���ve been getting monthly phone calls as promised and now every 2 weeks as we���re close to the delivery.

Saw an Ecletic Blue (light blue) on the road. At first I wasn't a fan but it's growing on me. The other colours seem a bit plain.Also is the 'Atomic Rush' more maroon or red (like Toyota's 'Wildfire')? I've seen conflicting colours on the net.
No fun having my pearl white AWD cruiser being challenged all the time by Holdens and fords. The Rav looks really aggressive especially with the black wheels so attracts a lot of challenges chuckles. Mostly Commodores, HSV utes, Falcons, Mazda 6s, 3s etc. I���ve beat and embarrassed them all so far and it used to be really funny to see their surprised and embarrassed faces haha. The RAV4 cruiser can take a 4.8L V6 Commodore from 0 to about 110. Then from there on the 4.8 litre gas guzzler starts to overtake. By then it���s all over though haha!But the fun is wearing out and these days I just let the challenges go . They try to swipe me to provoke me haha! The Commodore SS is harder to beat. You gain the lead up to 60 only.Is it just me or has this forum turned into a whining and venting cess pit?
Brian McGee writes...Also is the 'Atomic Rush' more maroon or red (like Toyota's 'Wildfire')? I've seen conflicting colours on the net.Picked up my Cruiser FWD in Atomic Rush today. More like maroon, however, the rego docs say red.Our wait was around 8 months.Many have said  before that it is worth the wait? I have to say, they are absolutely correct.

rroland writes...Is this recall only is America or are we affected toI think they build the RAV4 in America for those markets so it's likely we won't be affected since Australia gets them from Japan
Wrrr writes...The RAV4 cruiser can take a 4.8L V6 CommodoreI assume you mean the 3.8L V6?The ravs beating HSV utes and SS commodores in a drag? I heard they went alright but this surprises me.I test drove the hybrid and while spirited it did not feel as quick as my 17 year old HSV.
LOL writes...Hope you sort your issue out too ;Got mine working again. Just a bit of fiddling with it realiseing the new phone but is working as per usual now. Cheers
Brian McGee writes...Also is the 'Atomic Rush' more maroonYeah , I think its a dark burgundy colour to me. Too dark for my liking.  A bit lighter and I wouldnt have minded it. But it has nothing on the mazda red.The other colours seem a bit plain.Ill agree with you there. Thats why my choice was the eclectic blue. Stands out that's for sure. You dont lose it in a carpark!!But none of the other colours grabbed me, whites plain, black and saturn blue to dark, the greys too mediocre, and the red way too dark for me.
Wazza77 writes...test drove the hybrid and while spirited it did not feel as quick as my 17 year old HSV.While I am surprised at how my RAV performs I honestly don't think it is a match for a Commodore.0 to 100 for Rav is in the 8s right? Also,  under acceleration it feels more like a fwd than awd.Still love the car though,  economy is amazing IMO.
Wrrr writes...The RAV4 cruiser can take a 4.8L V6 Commodore from 0 to about 110Good way to flog the CVT with the awd launches
LOL writes...0 to 100 for Rav is in the 8s right?Rav4 was never designed to be a performance vehicle, was it? Why would anyone want to drive it like that?
LOL writes...While I am surprised at how my RAV performs I honestly don't think it is a match for a Commodore.Neither do I , just replying to the earlier post about it bowling over most cars in its path.lso,  under acceleration it feels more like a fwd than awdIs this because the AWD system only comes into play with loss of traction ? and the rear electric motor kicks in?Im not sure exactly how the system works as to applying power to the wheels, but I thought I had read something along those lines but am quite probably wrong.
The RAV4 I'm sorry to say wouldn't even come close to beating a V6 let alone a V8.The RAV4 is about 2 seconds slower to 100 than the V6 and ~4 seconds slower than the V8, you mean to say you beat them until they put their foot on the go fast pedal? Clearly they aren't trying or can't be bothered wasting fuel.
No feelings hurt at all, when someone states something that is complete and utter nonsense what do you expect to happen, didn't your mum ever tell you not to lie or were you thinking stretching the truth wouldn't hurt?I just so happen to own Australia's largest Commodore forum so I would believe I have a bit more credit than you think I do.I am happy to wait for mine, absolutely no hurry good things happen to those that wait. April isn't that far away to wait and I can beat HSVs too :p  Tomorrows story we'll be hearing how Wrrr takes on Tesla's from a rolling start or a V8 Supercar around Bathurst.
0-100's:Rav-4: 8.1 secV6: 6.2 secAnyway, a few RAV-4's in stock from cancelled orders around town in Sydney (Edge Cruiser). They wouldn't budge much on the price though, they know full well they can sell it by the end of a week at full price.

Cruiser AWD Hybrid. Am told a possible May delivery. Looking forward to getting it to replace my 2017 VW Golf Hyline TDI 110
Nice one. What accessories and did you manage to bargain down the price?
There���s  not many accessories to buy with the Cruiser model. I always get my local window tint man to do the windows on my new vehicles so I���ll definitely get that done. I did order a tow bar just for dragging the box trailer up to the tip.  As always, I got them to throw in front and rear mats as well as the rubber boot mat.I���ve never actually seen the Cruiser version because they only had a lower variant in stock at the dealership. When I test drove it, I knew it���s what I wanted. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance. Possibly not as fast as my Golf TDI but much better than I expected. I would have kept the Golf longer but I���ve got a feeling that the bottom is going to drop out of the second hand diesel market in the next year or so.
As someone who's been in both a 2020 GXL and a 2020 Cruiser, I can tell you the latter is streets ahead. Not so much performance but interior is just several notches better.
Littlelake writes...I got them to throw in front and rear mats as well as the rubber boot mat.Did you manage to bring down the cost of a tow bar ? I consider AWD cruiser and definitely need a tow bar for the same reason.
I picked it because it had all the features I wanted. Heated seats, sunroof, auto opening read gate etc. I���m just hoping that the RAV4 will be rattle free. Rattles are my pet  hate with any vehicle!
I have noticed that when I place my left foot on the foot rest it squeaks.It seems to be made of polystyrene and I think the sound is of it compressing under foot.Anyone else notice this?

On the Toyota website there should be a specs table you can download which compares each one.
Is there any benefit in having the AWD active all the time?
LOL writes...It seems to be made of polystyrene and I think the sound is of it compressing under foot.I noticed that during my test drive, apparently they make all footrests out of soft material now to prevent your foot from getting crushed during a frontal accident.

namhsirIrishman writes...Is there any benefit in having the AWD active all the time?In all honesty and this will vary from person to person but it depends on how the car will be used.If the chances of seeing any dirt, towing a boat or box trailer are there then AWD is probably a more suitable option.On the other hand if it will only ever see suburban roads 2WD will be more than ample.
Be aware-This appears to be North American.  The engine problem seams to be Canadian made units.Check the ��� 4.5 Rav4 Electric Hybrid forum ��� mostly from the north American people
I Have a GXL hybrid AWD. Rear motor only active on tack off and reverse. Also  activates on cornering or if there is slip. On a drive on bitumen straight ahead it is only FWD 90% of the time but regeneration is on both front and rear motors.I didn't get the The Cruiser because I Hate the Moon roof Leather seats that are useless in 40c HeatWe use Proper Lambs wool seat covers. Also no advantage to all round Cam and the slow as hell rear Hatch.Saved money on the cruiser hut spent the extra for AWD. For me it is the best alternative

Are those waiting long periods ordering from regional Toyota dealerships? One Toyota dealer told me they had a waiting list of 150, another said they are "one of Sydney's largest" so they get orders relatively quickly.

Wazza77 writes...I assume there is an AWD button to put it on full time? If so and the rear motor is electric, how would this work if the battery is getting flat in the vehicle? ( I dont understand this technology at this stage).You wont get it locked into awd. The software tells the power where to go. There is a trail mode but i think that just adjusts the traction and stability more than anything. I have seen a vid of one sliding the rear in the dirt, so it might send more to the back.If the battery is running out of juice the motor will charge it and keep power in reserve for the rear wheels. Id assume that you wont get full electric power if it was constantly toward the low end of charge but you would get some
Menco writes.... There is a trail mode but i think that just adjusts the traction and stability moYeah I did read about trail mode. I think it said it can sometimes send up to 80 percent of drive to the rear wheels. I was just thinking if you were doing some constant driving where you neeeded all wheel drive ( and had the option to turn it on constant ) how it would keep power to drive the rear electric motor after a while. Cheer mate for the details.

Current wait time 6 monthshttps://www.caradvice.com.au/826738/toyota-rav4-hybrid-waiting-time/The waiting time for a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid has been quoted from three months to more than a year. Here's the latest response from Toyota on this moving target.36 SHARESThe longest waiting time for customers to get their hands on a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser was up to eight months, Toyota Australia has confirmed to CarAdvice, after the company recently claimed the delay had been cut to three months.The popularity of the range-topping RAV4 Hybrid caught Toyota Australia off guard. The brand expected the Hybrid would equate to 20 per cent of RAV4 sales but, in June last year, it revealed demand was closer to 60 per cent.As a result, a month after the new RAV4 went on sale, a waiting period of up to four months was confirmed.However Toyota vice president of sales and marketing, Sean Hanley, last week told CarAdvice���s Automotive Industry Insights Podcast the wait is now longer.���The truth is, the highest it got to was around eight months, and that was late last year,��� Hanley said.We think by the end of this month (February), we will be able to get that down to around six months, and then by the second half, we think we might bring that down even further; maybe four months.���There have been varying reports, with some customers being told they face a 12-month wait by dealerships, but Hanley denied it.���This whole idea that there���s this 12-month wait ��� right now, there���s not. It���s around six months as we sit here today.���Hanley admitted Toyota Australia could���ve handled the communication better, by keeping customers and dealerships up-to-date with the waiting period.���What we got to do ��� and we understand we���ve got to do a better job of ��� is communicate to our customers those dates. But we���ve also got to open up the window of that communication to our dealer network, so we���ve recognised that."We���ve looked at this over the last two weeks because it���s deeply important we get this right. We���ve now put a process in place that will enable our dealers to give more accurate information to the customer. We���ve been communicating with our customers in various ways to reassure them the car is coming," Hanley concluded.Last month���s new car sales figures saw the RAV4 come out on top in the under $60,000 medium SUV segment with a 19 per cent share ��� a common occurrence since the all-new RAV4 was launched in the second quarter of 2019.
I���ve hired a few RAV4 Hybrids ��� nice car but the price I could not justify to purchase one.I get between 5.3 ��� 5.8 fuel economy which is good, but seeing non-hybrids get around 7 anyway the price premium doesn���t really justify it.The engine also sounds pretty rough considering it���s just spinning a generator ��� I would have thought a much smoother tubes powered unit would be both quieter and even more fuel efficient.
Strength Through Unity writes...the price premium doesn���t really justify it.I did some back of the envelope calculations and it really depends on how long you intend to keep it.The price difference between a 2WD hybrid and 2WD petrol for the Cruiser is approx $2k. Assume cost of petrol is $1.21/L. Given the fuel mileage difference is 1.8L/100km, this means it is $2.20 (1.21*1.8) more expensive for every 100km driven or $0.022 per km driven. Given the price difference, it���ll take you about 91000 kms ($2k/0.022) to break even or about 6 years of driving an average of 15k km per year. If the fuel price is more expensive then the break even time is lower.This doesn���t take into account the cost of the battery checks after 5 years if you want the hybrid battery warranty to be extended to 10 years (not sure if this costs extra but I assume so). Also the AWD only comes in hybrid and has much more towing power so that���s a consideration as well.Lastly hybrid is the most common variant so if you decide to sell in the future, it will yield a bigger market to which you���ll probably recoup the extra you spent.
Can someone please let me know real urban fuel usage for the non hybrid RAV?I didn���t consider non hybrid RAV but no other SUV of similar size to the RAV I tested got close to 6 litres per 100kms urban?All the diesels I tested were around 10 litres in real urban driving, despite what they write on brochure.No Korean, Japanese SUV petrol will be under 10 that I know of, that is before considering they are gutless compared to the RAV hybrid.Perhaps some of the VW group engines may be under 10 but not by much.Our X3 30i gets 10 -12 around town despite the brochure quoting under 8.6.2 on freeway.I���m easily getting 6 around town in the hybrid Rav and am constantly amazed.On top of that it has instant power when needed, I am a CVT and Hybrid convert. Used to think they were just for Greenies.Yesterday was heavy rain in Melbourne and first chance to drive in wet weather.I am now glad I went AWD, gave good traction and only minor signs of torque steer.
LOL writes...Can someone please let me know real urban fuel usage for the non hybrid RAV?I think ours is sitting on 9L per 100. Only done 400 kays though. That���s mostly town driving with one trip down the highway of about 100 kays. So actual in town may be slightly higher. But I don���t drive it heaps but will check the actual fuel usage next time I run around town and post it if I I remember.Edit. I should say I don���t have mine on eco modeIt���s in normal if that matters.

I called almost every dealer in VIC yesterday and found one AWD Hybrid Cruiser available and I'm picking it up Tuesday. Stoked! It was very tedious but worth it.There were two dealers that had about 3-6 week waits.
Strength Through Unity writes...non-hybrids get around 7 anyway the price premium doesn���t really justify itA few people have mentioned this for me however the reason to go hybrid was better performance as much as fuel efficiency. With almost all other cars people pay extra extra for the more powerful engine along with worse fuel economy.

Pradopete writes...A dealer���s fair share of the allocation is earned by a complex formula. Some small country dealer may only earn one every 2 months whereas a major metro dealer may earn 30 a month. The number of retail orders a dealer has, has little impact on the volume supply to a dealer but may affect the mix.Is this why larger dealers are more likely to discount, because they have more allotted, whereas smaller dealers have less allocations so they obviously want to sell their allotted Rav4's to the highest paying customers?  I did notice a lot of disparity after calling ~20 or so dealerships, some flat out refused to budge $200 whereas some knocked off thousands with little pressure.

I am comfortable with the level of engine noise in my November 2019 build car (I understand this is referred to as 2020 ). I am uncertain whether there is extra noise suppression compared to the test vehicle I drove in May 2019, but it is certainly quiet to my ears

Even though the fuel filler door in RAV4 hybrid has a yellow sticker "E10 compatible" on the inside, you really have to hate your new baby very badly to feed her E10 all the way...I only put U95 since I bought my Cruiser Hybrid in October, and here we are talking already a different price tag ��� find me U95 for $1.20 ?
At the end of the day it doesn't matter, everyone is different and has differing opinions.Look at some of these guys purchasing the 'basic' or pov model which has smaller boring rims, the smaller screen, no moonroof, no heated seats, no power boot, no electric seats and cheaper sound system because they 'hated' it or couldn't justify it.For me I like gadgets so easily justify the price, same with fuel I couldn't care less.U95 is irrelevant we weren't talking about U95, will probably end up using U95 or 98 myself but I am not concerned about any payback or anything along those lines.I figure going from owning modified cars which were 20-22L/100 to the CX-5s 5-7L/100 to the Cruiser Hybrid will be enough of a saving for me.Will agree though I feel for anyone using E10, cheaper but certainly not worth it.

This videohttps://youtu.be/TG2MdfYOyd4does some comparison showing the salon noise level improvement between 2019 and 2020 models. Although the guy is all over the shop, you can compare some numbers when he shuts up for a short while.5:02 ��� 2019: SPL=71dB @78mph9:14 ��� 2020: SPL=69dB @78mphTo me, the 2dB off the 70dB is not that impressive, but you have to compare the whole spectra (that is, how the noise "tastes") rather than just an integral number.Rumble sounds quite different to hiss of the same dB value.I am also wondering if sound deadening pad can be retrofitted to 2019 pre-October builds.

Someone in the Australian Facebook Group posted this pic under the hood of both the 2019 and 2020 models apparently showing the extra sound proofing:  https://pasteboard.co/IUWeU2U.jpg
What petrol are people using? Any noticeable difference from using 95/98?

Got my 2020 Toyota Rav4 Cruiser Hybrid 2WD in Pearl White last weekendI ordered around end of July with an initial estimate of 4 months. Original PROD date was October 2019.Did not get any update until early this year when my car was in Production. This is the time my dealer gave me access to the tracking profile.Once it got updated to "Scheduled for Production", it was quick. Got ETA of 10/02/2020.To answer your question, once it was in the ship (transport to Australia), it was approximately around 2 weeks when it changed status. So probably in 3 weeks it will be "being prepared for pick-up"

Break even point for hybrid can be roughly calculated as follows (in km)$2000 (extra price for Hybrid)Divided by [Cost of petrol] * 1.8 * 1001.8 = difference in fuel consumption per 100km between hybrid and non hybrid

Regarding a sound deadening in the RAV4 models made from October 2019.I opened the bonnet of my Cruiser Hybrid made in August 2019 and found that the pad is installed there.So, does the 2019->2020 sound deadening upgrade only apply to petrol model, because the Hybrids already had it from day 1? Or they improved the deadening and the 2020 Hybrid models come now with the more efficient bonnet pad?Related: Does the forum search engine search for particular posts? I couldn't figure out how to do that. For example, I want to search this topic for the posts containing the word "deadening", but the search only refers me to the topic itself, not to particular posts. I looked through the FAQ, but it didn't tell me how to zoom the search in to the particular post. What am I missing? If there is a reading  that you can refer me to?

How long does it take from 'In Production' to being shipped? Went into production last Friday.Sure this was mentioned recently but skimming over posts can't seem to find it.
How long does it take from 'In Production' to being shipped?I read somewhere that from sheet metal to driven out of the factory is 26 hours.However, from the day my status changed to 'In Production' to being on the boat was about a week.
Overall I think Kia Seltos GT is better choice IMO.Yes you save a bit on fuel on Rav 4 hybrid models over the years.But for comfort(including heated and ventilated seats), infotainment,tech, cabin quietness, price, practicality, 7 years warranty etc, I'm swinging towards Kia.

For us, who do somewhere between 5,000 ��� 8,000 km a year (inner city) but with a bub on the way, the break point even at 10,000km makes the petrol choice a bit easier to go with as I can't be arsed waiting 4 ��� 7 months for delivery.
Mr.Humble writes...Kia SeltosIMO they are not competitors. RAV is bigger.Kia is nice but you are better off comparing to sportage.Also, Toyota offers 7 years warranty too.Also, DCT gearbox may be less reliable over the years.
Not to mention resale value in the RAV4 in comparison to what will be a throwaway car at the end of the warranty.
Mr.Humble writes...Overall I think Kia Seltos GT is better choice IMO.I did look at the Seltos before I bought my Rav4. It was smaller , even the Kia salesman said it was small. He said they sold the Seltos mostly to couples without children. The salesman suggested looking at the Sportage. After looking I agreed, the Sportagae is closer comparison to a Rav4 than the Seltos.
bL@De writes...throwaway car at the end of the warranty.Why?Kia make fantastic cars these days. I would feel just as comfortable owning a Kia as a Toyota. The quality of the interior is superior in a sportage than my RAV IMO.
Purely from a resale point of view, I wouldn't go near one.
bL@De writes...Not to mention resale value in the RAV4 in comparison to what will be a throwaway car at the end of the warranty.All cars are pretty much a throw away at the end of the warranty and until recentlyToyota was 3 years and kia was 7 Now it���s IIrc 5/7
Mine is on a ship in transit to aus, it feels kind of surreal that after 7 months or so of waiting I���ll have this car next month. I really hope I love it when I get it.
I've had 6 Toyotas and had a great run out of all. I am a brand Man and I like toyota Range and marketing.Look at the New GR Yaris Great stuff Toyota. I also like Holden But no one buys them and now no more
Just want to know everyone's thoughts on a quote my broker gave me for a 2WD Hybrid Cruiser in Crystal Pearl.The driveaway price is $42995 with boot mat, silmline weather shield and headlight protector included.Wait is quoted at worst 7 months.The excel spreadsheet from other members on this forum are mostly for AWD Hybrid Cruiser only.
Had a quick look through the spreadsheet version history, someone messed up the Order Date column by sorting it around Jan 28th. Would be nice if someone fixed that without ruining the rest of the data (new entries might have been added in between, so shouldn't just copy and paste unless checked)I have recently picked up my Hybrid Cruiser, so I won't be referring to the spreadsheet anymore myselfNice car
Picking up my RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid AWD next week, requested the dealership to set the remote windows / sunroof opening by holding down the unlock button as suggested by others here previously, only to be told this is only available on GXL model and cannot be done on Cruiser due to different remote controllers.  Am I mistaken?
Matchaman  writes...told this is only available on GXL model and cannot be done on Cruiser due to different remote controllersDumb as dogturd dealership staff. It can be done on Cruiser.
Yeah it's a Techstream setting. They're just being slack.
Definitely being slack. My dealer is configuring it on my Crusier due in March.
chillemi writes...Yeah it's a Techstream settingIs there  something that needs to be done to enable the drivers seat preset to start working? I picked up our cruiser yesterday and coudnt get the seats to start auto adjusting ��� we could set the setting and hear the beep but once we change it around pressing "1" would do nothing... need to give it a proper go today.Just also checked our model does have a Feb 2020 compliance plate, has sound deadening and one illuminated window switch..But car was fantastic on the drive home, really happy with the value and feels great to drive.
Garbled writes...Is there  something that needs to be done to enable the drivers seat preset to start working?Power needs to be on. Move the seat where you want, then hold down set and press and hold 1 or 2 until it beeps.If you want to link it to your keys you can hold the number and press the door lock button on the arm rest and it'll auto adjust depending on who unlocks the door.Page 122 of the manual
chillemi writes...Power needs to be on.Rtfm, will try that thanks. Linking the preset to keys is also freaking awesome, thanks :)
Garbled writes...Rtfm, will try that thanks. Linking the preset to keys is also freaking awesome, thanks :)Yeah, dealer didn���t realise they did th is but I set it up the other day. Obviously only have one key fob in the vehicle at a time ��� the one you want to set as ���your ��� driving position.
section writes...me for a 2WD Hybrid Cruiser in Crystal Pearl.The driveaway price is $42995I think it seems ok. I paid 41000 for the FWD petrol and was quoted at 2 grand more ish for the hybrid cruiser. So about 43. That was with carpet matts and front tint. So I would think it���s reasonable. My prices were also for premium paint.  Cheers

Bismotion writes...How did you find the engine noise while accelerating?Under heavy acceleration you definitely can hear it, but it's much much better than the test drive I did early Jan (which must have been the 2019 model). Have only done 100k odd kms but have a long drive coming up so will report back then.Also with my seat looks like dealer forgot to set, I followed instructions here: https://www.toyotanation.com/threads/drivers-seat-memory-not-working.1646012/1. move your seat forward much as you can.2. move your seat higher much as you can.3. incline your seat much as you can.4. hold the set button and press 1.5. move driver side seat to the desired seat position.6. hold the set button and press 1.Boom, Seat memory now working.
Garbled writes...Under heavy acceleration you definitely can hear it, but it's much much better than the test drive I did early Jan (which must have been the 2019 model).Is your RAV4 petrol  or hybrid? Was the RAV4 you testdrove early Jan petrol or hybrid?Thanks.

I think things have changed in regards to having to wait months for these cars if you're prepared to do the ground work.A guy on the Australian 2020 Rav4 Facebook forum has manged to get two Hybrid Cruisers within the space of less than 5 weeks.First one was a 4 week wait and the second just a few days!:-----o
Has anyone considered/carried out replacing the driving light/fog lamp globes in their Cruiser with LED's?
Wazza77 writes...Apparently so mate.We will be getting ours done at the complimentary check over serviceUnderstood. Is there anything else a dealer should do when I pick up the car? (I'll be 300km away from them so I can't exactly go back if they forget something...)
Brian McGee writes...Is there anything else a dealer should do when I pick up the car?Dunno , others may have some ideas.There are things I want to fiddle with the car but are mainly in the manual. Just haven't had time.As someone suggested, I've just turned on the road sign assist for the cruise control as it wasn't on in the car when new. Which will be very handy.Also have matched the key fobs to the drivers memory seat position, which the dealers weren't sure was possible. And also want to turn down the beep of the rear tailgate. Will get to that.
Brian McGee writes...Is this something only the dealer can do?You can actually change the Techstream settings yourself, but you have to buy a knockoff USB to OBD2 cable. You can then get a 1 day license for Techstream Lite off Toyota's website for like $10.
Wazza77 writes...As someone suggested, I've just turned on the road sign assist for the cruise control as it wasn't on in the car when new. Which will be very handy.Was that in the standard car settings or did you require an OBD2 link for that?
SLedGE writes...Has anyone considered/carried out replacing the driving light/fog lamp globes in their Cruiser with LED's?I picked up my AWD Cruiser Hybrid Wednesday morning and I've loved everything about it. It's so powerful when needed, it's whisper quiet (don't understand the noise complaints I've read) and I've done about 300kms so far and I'm at 6l/100km which is awesome given my driving has been 50% freeway and 50% local trips around town.SLedGE, I have looked into changing my interior cabin lights to LED as I don't like the halogen lights and found this on YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHHrpYNE1fAIt seems pretty straight forward. There is another for the backseat light too. Fog lights, yeah, I'd like to change those but want to do interior first. Has anyone successfully done this? What globes did you use and from where?Question, what tyre pressure have people been getting? I checked mine yesterday as I usually go a few PSI higher than what the plate says (think it says 33psi) and it says they're at 56psi and I'm wondering if they're filled with nitrogen? not sure, brain is fried. It can't be air at that pressure though. Dealer said to stop by and they'll have a look but curious if anyone else has had the same with their tyre pressure?EDIT: Also was surprised to learn that you get $100 off Rego with Hybrids. I think I saw that somewhere in this thread but had forgotten :)

Littlelake writes...Don't the Cruisers already come with LED headlights (parabolic or projector depending on which Cruiser)?They are talking about the lower fog lights. And regarding the road sign assist for the cruise control it is done in the car menu using the steering wheel controls. The menu pops up on the digital dash section and you go in and switch it on
I like the new edgy look of the rav4. And would only need one because of a growing family. Like most young families we���re conscious of money. The 2020 base model is 36k and in 2016 was 30k. A second hand 2016 rav near new is 25k. Why has the shopping trolly with wheels gone up 6k in 4 years?. I want 2016 prices.

We picked up our Jan 2020 built GXL AWD Hybrid today and it's heaps quieter than the '19 built GXL AWD Hybrid vehicle we test drove

Can anyone with a Hybrid RAV4  confirm whether or not they have had any problems completely filling a tank? I���ve read that some USA vehicle cannot fill beyond about 90% of the tank before the bowser shuts off.

Thanks all, the dealership eventually did it after I told them I'll bring the car to another dealership for future car services to change the Techstream setting.  They claimed it's something new that they weren't aware of...!

The last several litres take longer as it triggers the shut off from splashback against the nozzle but I always fill right up. Never been able to just not be able to fill more than 90%.
Wazza77 writes...Wether it���s got to do with the car or how our fuel pumps are designed I can���t tell you. But apparently it���s been a non issue here in oz.It's simple ��� we are turned upside down here, so the petrol flows more freely off the cock and fills up a tank completely.
Littlelake writes...My new Cruiser AWD Hybrid should be here next week or the week after (3-4 weeks from order date)I assume you managed to snag a cancellation? Well done.Meanwhile my Sydney dealer told me this week he is now quoting 12-18 months wait-time on hybrid cruisers and he expects a further two-month blow-out on existing orders.I���m now past five months wait time with no confirmed production month.I guess we all know that Toyota gives preferential  treatment to some dealers.But can anyone explain in detail how (and why) some dealers get preferential treatment?Wouldn���t it be better if everyone in Australia just went in a single queue?As a buyer, how are you supposed to know which dealer will get you your car in a matter of weeks and which will take a year?Should I cancel my order and go looking around NSW for a quicker order?
Golf3000 writes...Meanwhile my Sydney dealer told me this week he is now quoting 12-18 months wait-time on hybrid cruisers and he expects a further two-month blow-out on existing orders.That seems contrary to what the VP of Toyota Australia said a few weeks ago. Unless they know more than him, I���m guessing they have their figures wrong.
Brian McGee writes...Meanwhile my Sydney dealer told me this week he is now quoting 12-18 months wait-Spoke to my dealer on Friday about waiting times for the RAV4. 9 Months for the Hybrid Cruiser and 6 months for the others (hybrids)
Golf3000 writes...Meanwhile my Sydney dealer told me this week he is now quoting 12-18 months wait-time on hybrid cruisers and he expects a further two-month blow-out on existing orders.A big ask for people to commit to a vehicle that far away. A lot can change in 18 months including new vehicles from other makers that may alter a buyers choice and of course pricing if more hybrid options become available.I know the delays are not a marketing strategy by Toyota but some other cars such as the new cx-30 (which has no market killing feature and not hybrid) are also supposedly in short supply. Makes my cynical mind think that perhaps this may gain footing with limited supply reducing price bargaining and the fear of missing out or facing long waits adding pressure to buyers to act now. In effect lower inventory (or drip feeding) equals lower costs which would need to be balanced against potential lost sales.Food for thought.
Littlelake writes...Can anyone with a Hybrid RAV4  confirm whether or not they have had any problems completely filling a tank? I���ve read that some USA vehicle cannot fill beyond about 90% of the tank before the bowser shuts off.Mine always shows full after a fill and usually estimates 950 to 1000km for the tank. Just odd the most i can put in is 45L. I thought the specs show a capacity of 55 to 60, can't remember
Williered writes...with limited supply reducing price bargaining aI called several Toyota dealers and I���d say half wouldn���t discount whereas the other half would.
The other thing is in the US in a few states you're not allowed to pump your own gas, so if the attendant doesn't keep filling when it clicks you might not get a full tank.
I managed to get out an drive the '19 Petrol Cruiser. Both the wife and I are quite happy with it and got told it's a 4 ��� 6 month wait on a hybrid. Got him to knock up a quote which came out to $44k + a $1500 visa cc as the wheels got mixed up in Japan and have the GXL wheels and that we could pick it up this week.It must be post Oct 2019 as it comes with Airplay. So, for the '20 models, is there much difference (a quick google search seems to suggest a new media tablet).When I said I'd happily pay cash and what would that mean for the price. He said throw us a number and we can start from there. Looking at the quote there's a delivery fee of $1,895..... So immediately knocking that out takes you down to $42k. Would I be asking too much for a further 5% off as I'm paying by cash ($40k) + a further $2k for a '19 model and it being end of  month for quotas.So, all up, a starting price of $38k and walk away from the deal if it reaches $42k? Too cheeky?
���SSSK writes...Looking at the quote there's a delivery fee of $1,895..... So immediately knocking that out takes you down to $42kCan I ask why you are knocking this fee out ? Isn���t it part of the ���whole��� price they work out anyway ? , even if it is on the lot ?Surprised they have a petrol cruiser sitting there to be honest. How many kms ? Just to get an idea of how many may have test driven it.And even being a 2019 I think 38k not achievable. Somewhere between the 40 and 41 mark maybe if it���s been on the lot a little bit and driven by a few people  ? Is it a premium colour one would assume ?
Toyotas routinely leave some fuel in the tank when fuel gauge reads empty. In my RAV4, there is about 9-10 litres. This is apparently necessary to lubricate and cool the fuel pump and to minimise chances of sucking up the crud which concentrates in the bottom of the tank
���SSSK writes...Looking at the quote there's a delivery fee of $1,895..... So immediately knocking that out takes you down to $42k.That delivery fee is not necessarily just the cost involved in the delivery of the vehicle to the dealership..but is also.. designed to cover all the costs to dealer in preparing the car for delivery to you ��� hand over (eg; mechanics checks, removing protective plastics, admin costs, etc, etc). There's always a lot of excess built into these charges.You could try get the 'delivery fee' amount down but it would be very unlikely for the dealership to completely waive that fee.
Hello everyoneI have been offered 2020 rav 4 gxl 2wd in black for 37000$ drive away. Is that a good deal with mats and front windows tint?
Hybrid?Colour?
Petrol 2.0L black colour. Sydney city toyota advised i can get it by 28feb as there is a long waiting period on hybrids and cruisers. Wasnt really fussy as i need it for day to day drive school child care pick and drop. They also said since people have started buying petrols rather than hybrid even then they are unable to get them so soon especially cruisers.
American only problem.

There's always a lot of excess built into these charges.The delivery fee does not include the delivery of the vehicle to the dealer, it is the delar's charge to deliver it to you. It includes washing the car, peeling off the plastic, filling up the tank and screwing on the number plates. That's all. The real value of this is $200 at best, however it's another way the dealers make the money.You never negotiate the delivery fee, you negotiate the net price of the vehicle, so if you want a grand or two off the price of the car, then you offer $41k instead of $43k or whatever, but not negotiating the delivery fee. It's up to the dealer how to make this price reality. If they can't ��� you walk away and play it smart. They'll call you back.Negotiating the price of the vhicle is a specific art and you need to know quite a few things; the deler stock, if they have met or are close to meet their sales target, be there on specific date and have your finances completely sorted out. You also need to negotiate price of the vehicle before any discussion about finance takes place. You don't give them any hint on this, nothing.I generally always get about 10% of the listed price.And, oh, you never trade in a used vehicle, unless you want to lose $3-5k or even more.Having said that, it's a matter of supply and demand, on some cars in some situations you can get significant savings, but when the supply is as short as RAV4s at the moment, you have a very little room to move, if any.
RommeI writes...I generally always get about 10% of the listed price.Depends entirely on the car and its demand. If you got 10% off a hybrid cruiser recently then I take my hat off to you. Best I got was about 8%.
Brian McGee writes...Depends entirely on the car and its demand. If you got 10% off a hybrid cruiser recently then I take my hat off to you. Best I got was about 8%.I agree completely. With RAV4 hybrids pretty much any discout is a success so 8% is top-work, although wait times are pain.
We just picked up our GXL (petrol), and just getting used to all the various functions.  Does anyone know how we can turn off the female voice that reminds you obey all road rules each time you go a few km over the speed limit?  Or how to extend the km range before it gets activated?And before anyone comments ��� yes I get that we should be driving within the speed limits and can see the value of it when you're actually speeding ��� but the voice comes on when we are literally just over the limit by just a few km/hr which is really annoying.  I've checked the manual and can't seem to find anything ��� so any info would be gratefully received, thank you!

Thanks for the responses, I was looking at the $1,900 fee as something that should be built into the cost of the car. If the dealership has mechanics onsite where's the big inconvenience to them to sell me a car from their lot? Any final checks done to the car should be ensuring they're covered for liability reasons i.e. selling a 'unsafe' vehicle.I guess I think of a similar example of buying a pre-made desk/table. Would you accept paying an additional 5% on the purchase figure for them to check the bolts holding the desk up and that there aren't any scratches?RommeI writes...I generally always get about 10% of the listed price.Cheers for the insight Rommel. To get 10%, does that mean you start off from 15% off and 'work' your way to the 10%?I had them throw in a quote for rubber mats + a tow bar (extra $1,244). So I was contemplating telling them rather than us go through a barter where I start out at 38-39k, why don't they just throw in the mats + bar and knock off $1500 on the delivery fee ($2,744) from the total to make it an even $42.5k drive away?
It's really hard to tell, it depends on asking price, on the demand for the vehicle, stock levels, date in the months, etc.There are three 'first' things you need to do first:1st ��� find a vehicle at a delership that offers you what you would be willing to pay if everything else fails, so that is your walk-back strategy, and leave this one alone for now.1st ��� sort your source of funds.Do not let the dealer source your finance, they will take you for a ride, they get kickbacks left, right and centre, and you are the one who pays this (loan establishment fee $800-2000 for 10 min of work, dealer commission $500-$2000, also 10 min work and of course interest rate that they will tell you that they can do nothing about it. Oh, also the monthly account keeping fee (5 year loan = 60 x $5-$10 = $300-$600) Credit unions will generally give you 5-6% with no monthly fees and $100-200 establishment fee.1st  ��� go to the dealer on 28th of the month or later. This is when they are desperate to meet their sales targets. One car can bring them over the line and scoop 10s of thousands of money, so they will be awilling to do anyithgn you want.2nd ��� you do not trade in, this is a purest possible loss of $2-5k, maybe even more. Sell privately. Always.Now you start negotiating.You lowball, say for a  listed $45k car, you sart with "I have another delaer who is willing to sell me the same car for $39,5k, but it's not my favourite colur" When they ask who is it just respond with "nice try, hehe".See what they can come up with, say you're happy to pay that price if you offer me the right colour.They will counter offer something in between and you need to be firm there. They will ask you what accessories you need, how do you finance, do you have a trade in ... all these are designed to get more money out of you.Do NOT show any emotions, and don't take your partne or kids under any circumstances. A single "but I love this car" will cost you $1000.They will go to 'ask the boss' which is bullshit, they just give you time to simmer on your doubts and to cave in to their demands.The more they go back and forth, the more desperate they are to meet the sales target, so that's a good news. If they flatly refuse and say we can give you the car for x amount and don't budge, you either buy it, go back to your walk-back dealer or wait another month.Once they start offering you accessories, be aware that it's anotehr con. They will say we'll include floormats and window tint for nothing. They will say that this is a saving og $110 for mats and $400 for tint, but for them it's really $30 for mats and $250 for tint.Then you can say, OK, finen I'll take the car for $40k with these inclusions and close the deal.Of course, the $39.5k wrong colour deal with another deler is just a bluff, never happened.If they don't get to where you want it, be ready to walk away. THe car will never ever go up in price, it will only get cheaper next months, quarter, year. Be patient.I know this sounds hard and complicated, but that's how it is. It's an open market, they have goods, you have the money. The question is at what point you meet each other's demand and exchange your valuables.It's as simple as that. Same as buying something at garage sale, they want 50 bucks for a chair, you offer $30 and you meet somewhere ... or not.I have bought and sold many cars in my life and I'm not a dealer, never worked for or with one and have no association with any of them.

Whatever you agree wil then come with +1500 visa.

Also, make sure that you���ve done your homework and know the value of what you���re buying and the value of your trade (if you have one). I���m always prepared to walk away if I���m not happy and have done so on many occasions.I���m very happy with my deal and the 3-4 week delivery on a Cruiser Hybrid AWD with my preferred choice of colour.I found my local dealer to be very obliging and he was very keen to sell even with the high demand for these vehicles.This is my first entry into a hybrid after 4 turbo diesels in the last seven years. I love the torque and economy of the diesel cars but the European emissions requirements have pretty much put an end to their era and I suspect resale values will also be affected in coming years. My test drive of the  RAV4 4 Hybrid was better than I expected. Whilst probably not performing as well as my previous turbo diesels, it did far exceed my performance expectations  and is certainly more than enough. I���m really looking forward to getting it in the next week or so.

Hey guys, my late October RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser order is now showing up as "Planned Production Month: March" in the toyota tracking website. Is the tracker normally accurate from everyones experience on here?
Milano Red writes...Hey guys, my late October RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser order is now showing up as "Planned Production Month: March" in the toyota tracking website. Is the tracker normally accurate from everyones experience on hereI ordered my Hybrid Cruiser in very late December and the online tracker had a delivery estimate of 27/02/20. My car is currently at the dealer (as of Friday) for delivery prep. Guessing I will get it in the next few days so the tracker seems pretty accurate.
Cloudripper writes...Is the tracker normally accurate+1Visited dealer yesterday. Said they can sell their next yard order (it is to be their next demo) in March production (GXL Hybrid 2.5 Lt dark blue). I think an RRP around $46k was mentioned?  They have just sold some cancelled orders, so nothing there at the moment. Also told me the Council has just ordered about 30. Anyone bought dealer stock to avoid the 6+ month wait? Don't want that wait as they can revalue your trade, & that's probably why there are cancelled orders.
Do Toyota dealers still provide tracking details? I think I read somewhere they no longer do.
Planned production means nothing. I ordered in September and my planned production date has changed every month since.  Fyi ��� latest for me is now April 2020.
SeeBee101 writes...Fyi ��� latest for me is now April 2020.I thought the tracker can only show one month in advance? Eg. Builds are confirmed at the end of the previous month for next month.

blutek writes...Anyone bought dealer stock to avoid the 6+ month wait?We bought a Jan '20 built GXL hybrid that the dealer had on order and it matched what we wanted so we bought it. Ordered 1-2 days before Christmas and we took delivery on Friday 21st Feb (last week).We got it for $43,505 including CTP+rego for 1 yr, full tank petrol, slim line number plate and RAV4 rubber mats, as well as RAV4 branded rubber boot liner.
Mine has been sitting on ���In Production��� since the 14th Feb, still indicating 6th April delivery so guess it must have just missed a shipment and waiting for the next is my guess.
EQUIPED writes...We got it for $43,505well done was that a cash price? I get the feeling our dealer won't budge from RRP and then probably full cost on accessories.
Man I���m realising how lucky i was to get a discount on my cruiser hybrid, I can���t imagine with the demand there���s much wiggle room now
It's worth calling car brokers, you've got no obligation to go with them. I wasn't able to negotiate my Cruiser Hybrid AWD less than $49k from the stealers in Perth. My broker got it for $46700 with the standard tank of fuel and floor mats.
Brian McGee writes...Do Toyota dealers still provide tracking details?

Every step of the way is nothing short of 0/10 detractor.

I just put a deposit down for a Hybrid Crusier AWD (Graphite) for $46.3k driveaway, with the standard cargo mats/floor mats/tank of petrol. Better than the four brokers I dealt with.There's 50 or so Toyota dealers each competing against each other in Sydney alone and if you put in the hard yards you can get a great price.SmellyTofu writes...Sorry Toyota cust experience is f���ed if they were in any other industryI agree. I've seen tits on a bull more useful than them. E.g. I asked them a simple question about the VLT% of the stock privacy glass on my Corolla. Their response: "Yes we confirm there is privacy glass on your Corolla. Thank you for your enquiry and I hope I helped". They either use robots to answer emails or monkeys.
Brian McGee writes...There's 50 or so Toyota dealers each competing against each other in Sydney alone and if you put in the hard yards you can get a great price.Imho you prob got the right dealer trying to meet their target at the right timeIf a dealer has a 6 month lead time and it���s a sort after product that���s sold out that far ahead then they don���t have an incentive to discount heavily unless they are short of sales across the month and have to meet their targets
Brian McGee writes...I just put a deposit down for a Hybrid Crusier AWD (Graphite) for $46.3k driveaway, with the standard cargo mats/floor mats/tank of petrol.Which is pretty much my price walking into the dealer less two hundred odd coz I said no to mats etc all of which would be cheaper online.VLT% would be in the info on their restricted online system but this info may not be readily available.

blutek writes...well done, was that a cash price?Yeah cash price...but not that it mattered to them. I showed them the price examples on the Google sheet that was put together by a noble WP member here. I gave them a number and after 20 mins of to and fro, we signed.
Brian McGee writes...Hybrid Crusier AWD (Graphite) for $46.3kThis was almost the price we were given ($47k with same inclusions as you mentioned) too, but my FIL wasn't keen on Cruiser so we settled on the GXL.
I had one dealer ask me 'what makes you think you should get it for that price?' when I suggested $47.5k. It felt very nice to tell him to shove it when he came back to me with his 'one time offer' the day after.

Hah, I offered $39.5k drive away on a '19 cruiser with mats + towbar and would pay cash this week (i.e. end of month) as they had a '20 cruiser for $43k drive away.Simply got told "thanks anyway" with no counter off.

My order has moved to scheduled for production, ordered in Oct 2019.
We have no access to the tracker in the West. Reason is that back in the early 60th entrepreneur Stan Perrin signed WA Toyota distribution with Toyota Japan directly. Meaning is doesn���t come under the auspices of TMCA, although it does with Management. My dealer gave me more or less regular updates and I���m pleased to say that my Cruiser AWD Hybrid is ready for pick up after pretty much 6 month waiting period. Stoked that I finally can drive my new Set Coat CABM03 of wheels next weekend ????
Yeah i did feel i should have spent a couple thousand dollars and waited another 6 months BUT since my company pays for the fuel and im going to sell it in a couple of years i didn't think much and went for it. Getting the car on friday :)
Brian McGee writes...I got a copy of my contract, noticed there's no year model specified nor is there a maximum odometer reading. Is this standard for Toyota contracts?Yeah my contract had no built date and none of the details. I am keeping quiet for now and ask the dealer to show me the build date vin number etc when its ready to pick up. I guess they fill that in once your car is ready to pick up?
My dealer mentioned the odometer on the contract is filled in once the car arrives into the dealership. He confirmed in writing it���ll be less than 30km though. Makes very little sense to me but I���m satisfied with his confirmation.FWIW my previous Toyota purchase was the same and it had 10km on the odo when I picked it up.Apparently you should have received an updated buyer���s order after the car���s in production.
Can I ask how much deposit people paid to secure an order?
$500 last November. The dealer has such a backlog of orders, which he physically showed us, that if we cancel at any time we would get a refund no questions asked as someone else would snap up the car.
$1,000

Calling him up and letting him know to make sure it doesn't clock unnecessary km's. 30km on a brand new car sound alot. I did read someone suggested dealers sometimes give your car for test drive?

Just want to confirm with everyone. The new Rav 4 hybrid service is capped at $215 and that is once a year only?
Maverick2020 writes...30km on a brand new car sound alot.I don't think it's a lot, the intention of restricting the km's in a contract is only to ensure it's not used for a test drive. I doubt any Toyota dealer would even think about letting the car go on a test drive if they know the contract is toasted if the test driver takes it for a prolonged drive and exceeds 20km (+10km already on the odo), it's just not worth the risk.30km to accommodate necessary movements seems reasonable, especially if your car has accessories installed and the dealership needs to take it to nearby places to get them installed (e.g tinting).Maverick2020 writes...I guess ask them to put a bow and throw in a few baloons so they cant lol.Just to play devil's advocate, nothing's really stopping them from doing that after the test drive (if they decided to).section writes...Just want to confirm with everyone.

Refer to whrl.pl/Rf0tp4Short answer ��� no.Long answer ��� no, but if there's enough pressure on Toyota Australia they might implement it through firmware upgrades.
digital_silence writes...So, if you would like to see that side mirror autofold in your RAV4 eventually, please call Toyota Australia, and put the same request under your name/rego. That way, we will hopefully reach the critical mass of nagging.The question then boils down to whether the hardware for this functionality already exists. If this is the case, then perhaps it's as simple as a firmware upgrade.However, the fact that kits like these (see below) exists suggests a piece of hardware componentry is missing.

The fact the Toyota staff don't even realise the function is missing probably suggests it's way too early days.I'm guessing Toyota Australia stripped out some key features like this and the digital RVM in the UK/US variants to remain cost competitive.

Not really sure what the value is of comparing insurance premiums, it's dependent on so many factors and what's cheapest for you might be most expensive for me. Common sense is pull up a long list of insurance providers, brew a big jug of coffee and gets quotes from each one.
Brian McGee writes...Not really sure what the value is of comparing insurance premiumsNo doubt I get where you���re coming from. But I think as long as people offer  as much detail as possible it gives a greater idea. As seen above three people , including me, are in the 500-600 margin which is way off what the other persons (maverick) price was quoted above.
Couldn't agree more Wazza, gives people a referencing point on whether or not they might be paying too much sure comes down to driving history, location, parking, km's, excess and options but they can only vary soo much.Just wait for massive increases after the recent floods, fires and hail storms.Edit: But spot on nothing easier than bringing up a whole swag of insurers and tick them off one by one, you narrow it down super quickly.
You know it���s funny re insurance. Thought I���d check up on my older car with youi after seeing their advertising. Their price was 150 more than I was paying. After telling them of my insurer and price and such they came in about $4 cheaper a month after negotiating. Mind you with my current insurer I could let anyone drive the car and still be covered. With youi each had to be nominated. So say my cousin was in town and wanted to drive it, I had to let them know. In case he pranged it. With my current insurer this wasn���t the case. You really do need to be comparing apples with apples. And it���s a mine field.
Just picked up my AWD Cruiser this morning. Love it!Apple Car play I couldn't get to work initially but turning the car off and on again at home seemed to fix it.
RAC WA is $516 pa. Because I have a Cruiser AWD Hybrid I got a discount for low emissions. Basic excess $500
I am a new joinee to the RAV4 waiting line. Booked the Hybrid Cruiser AWD in Atomic Rush on Australia Day for 46.2k in Sydney.Price ��� there is no point discussing the prices based on my experience ��� there are just two prices out there for the whole of the Hybrid RAV range. One for the retail and one for the fleet. The one for the retail is a tad flexible ��� maybe upto a 1000 max, but no dealer is budging really. I got the fleet price. And it comes with a tank full of E10 (which I have clearly instructed the dealer not to, but I know they still will), floor mats and a few other standard bits and pieces.Wait Time ��� Told that there is a wait time of 6 to 8 months. What surprises me is the variances in the wait times ��� Toyota Exec was stating it is now 6 months, dealer says that nothing much has changed really. It is all confusing and not the best of the experience in real sense. Yes, Toyota has been caught off guard about 6 months back. but 6 months is a very long time in real sense to fix their supply chain issues and it is clearly not an industry first. I can understand that production happen in batches of similar models and trims and so a Hybrid Cruiser AWD with black interiors may differ in delivery times to the one with nutmeg interiors. Or that a GXL and Cruiser may have different waiting queues, but then, this seems to be utter chaos.Apple faced a similar situation during the iPhone 3, 4 and 5 era, but then they dealt with it and with each launch, managed their supply chain better. Toyota on the other hand doesn't really seem to care. I am worried that the very car that got them the adulation and monies will end up being a noose around their neck if they don't seem to get a control of the situation.
praskoll writes...no dealer is budging reallyI don���t agree ��� in my experience around half the dealers I spoke to in Sydney discounted (around 5%) whereas the other half gave the usual spiel about it being so high in demand etc so they can���t do anything. The price you got is around the same price I got (non-fleet).full of E10How do you know they use E10?
Brian McGee writes...The question then boils down to whether the hardware for this functionality already exists. If this is the case, then perhaps it's as simple as a firmware upgrade.If you can operate the mirrors manually ��� you can operate them remotely/automatically. The only difference in hardware is a switch (3-position in UK vs 2-position in AU), and maybe associated wire for the 3rd position. Also (I am guessing here), the power to the mirrors stepper motors may be taken from Vacc, rather than from Vbat.However, the fact that kits like these (see below) exists suggests a piece of hardware componentry is missing. Which means it'll be impossible for it to be implemented via a simple software upgrade.This kit is dodgy, as in the different listing, the seller sells exactly the same item for pre-2018 RAV4.I'm guessing Toyota Australia stripped out some key features like this and the digital RVM in the UK/US variants to remain cost competitive.To me, the cost of stripping this feature off looks higher than if they would keep it ��� yet another inventory part (switch and cover) to maintain, BOM variants management etc. And what have they saved? For the expense of having annoyed their customers? 0.01 cents worth of wire?
I got quite a good discount with my cruiser tbh, I think it depends on the individual sales person and what targets they need to hit.No matter what you���re going to wait so might as well try and get some $$$ off if you can.
Brian McGee writes...How do you know they use E10?My daily drive to work involves stopping at a bunk to pick my coffee and invariably, early in the morning the nearby Toyota and Lexus dealership sends in their deliveries for the day to be filled with the green juice. Reason ��� It is cheaper for them, though it is anything but green for the planet. How E10 is manufactured and the net effect on the planet is a whole different topic ��� one thing for sure, it is not as green as what it is made out to be.
digital_silence writes...For the expense of having annoyed their customers?I agree and it seems like common sense didn't prevail at the end of the day. If they can have a key-fob activate a seat setting then surely it's a no brainer to have auto closing side mirrors. Something must have been missed during the approvals process.
Brian McGee writes...I'm guessing Toyota Australia stripped out some key features like this and the digital RVM in the UK/US variants to remain cost competitive.Precisely. These variations are inevitable. Comparing the prices of the RAV4 with respect to the competition in those markets, the RAV4 price proposition is very good in Australia, even without some additional bells and whistles that those markets get.
praskoll writes...even without some additional bells and whistles that those markets get"Additional" ?Auto-folding mirrors is a STANDARD feature even for Toyota RAV4 ��� they had to deliberately put the ADDITIONAL efforts to strip it off for AU market, for virtually zero COGS saving. The only (evil) reason I can see for that sort of things is that they intentionally de-featured RAV4, because otherwise why would anyone buy Lexus with pretty much the same feature pack for twice the price?

If yours made the March planned production month ��� check your ETA for delivery now.
This feels like a really stupid question to ask, but I'm going to ask anyway!For those who have bought the new RAV4 ��� where have you installed your toll beeper thing (i.e. Linkt or previously called Go Via in QLD, not sure what its called in other states).  In our other (older) cars, we had them installed right up by the rear vision mirror ��� but we can't do that in the RAV4 due to all the camera and sensor stuff thats right there.  So we're just a bit unsure of where the best spot is to install it, so that it doesnt look like a total eyesore, but still 'beeps' when we go through toll roads and does what it needs to.Thoughts?  Thanks!
People install it anywhere they like ��� as long as it does not obstruct the driver's vision. The sweet spot under the mirror normally works best. The only sensor that can be found there is a rain sensor, I believe. Etoll tag and rain sensor live very well together on my Mazda Cx5 ��� I guess this applies to the new RAV4 as well.
Has anyone bought the optional dash camera and if so how much was it?Also does it work thru the infotainment screen.I am guessing the rear camera / rear view mirror isn't available in Australia. The non auto folding mirrors seems ridiculous to me, my 2013 Corolla even has them.Its very handy when I park at  a public car park and get 50 metres away and then cant remember if I locked the car.All I have to do is look back and see if they are folded in.Now I will have to walk 50 metres back.
dad writes...The non auto folding mirrors seems ridiculous to me, my 2013 Corolla even has them.And the new corollas have them as well!
Quite honestly, I am not that fussed about the folding mirror ��� again, personal opinion and preference, not that I am expressing any disagreements here.More keen to know more about the JBL audio system. Can anyone owning it provide their opinion or their review of the same.
Auto fold mirrors are easy to install and those kits are rudimentary in design by detecting the signal to the ACC (off) and central locking trigger (lock) to them trigger fold using the constant power. Fitted them to all my cars with power fold mirrors.Btw, 2013 Corolla never had auto fold until this generation and never was available to add or delete. Power fold was just given to the product planners.
The 2013 Corolla definetly does have auto folding mirrors. Maybe it was only the Levin model that I have but probably not the others.
~NZGirl~ writes...or those who have bought the new RAV4 ��� where have you installed your toll beeper thingOn my current and previous vehicles with windscreen mounted cameras, I always install the eTag high up and just to the left of the camera zone where I can't see it from the drivers seat. That way, it has no impact on my visibility.

Maybe it was only the Levin model that I have but probably not the others.I was in product planning at Toyota at the time and no Toyota has auto fold. Power fold yes, auto no. If it was, then it is a mis-build and wasn���t picked up. FYI, not even the Japanese Auris had auto fold as it is an accessory.
Mmm, interesting, will have to find someone else with a Levin and see if they have it.Mind you, I did buy it 2nd hand so maybe the previous owner had an aftermarket kit fitted.
dad writes...Has anyone bought the optional dash camera and if so how much was it?About $580. From my knowledge does not hook up to info system. But looked like it is a clean install. We didn���t go ahead but. Has some nice features though and may get it down the track.

Great sound through Bluetooth when connected and even cleaner when hooked through CarPlay. Has good bass from the sub. I used to enjoy a good stereo in my younger days but haven���t worrid much over the years in my current VY clubsport. But one of the reasons I liked the cruiser was for the JBL system. It has not dissapointed. Haven had it at full blast yet but have cranked it to more than loud enough and now I look forward to a road trip again. Mind you the other half doesn���t like it !!
praskoll writes...More keen to know more about the JBL audio system. Can anyone owning it provide their opinion or their review of the same.Struggles at high volume with bass-intensive music, otherwise it's pretty good.

I have not heard the JBL system but to my pretty fussy ears the stereo sound quality in my GXL is pretty damn good.I have not tested it intensively but it has been a pleasant surprise.

It���s never been a big thing for me having a cam. Maybe we should. I���d find it most useful in a car park scenario when no one is in the car but it gets bumped and records what happened.

Can someone tell me when do you get the UserCode and Password to track Rav4? Straight away or once its in production?
infohntr writes...k Rav4? Straight away or once its in production?Some people have got it early. Some when it goes to production. For me it was the latter. But saved me refreshing every day to see nothing had happened. The dealer did say that once production was firm they would send it to me. And they did.
Wazza77 writes...No doubt I get where you���re coming from. But I think as long as people offer  as much detail as possible it gives a greater idea.

infohntr writes...Can someone tell me when do you get the UserCode and Password to track Rav4?UserCode is a retail code and password is a batch number. I accidentally spotted them on a screenshot my salesperson sent to me. He didn't want to give me access to the portal, in fact, so it appeared he was quite surprised when I managed to get there :) It was about 3 months after I signed a contract.
Now to work out the dealer code. My selling dealer has ignored email regarding log in details nor told me an updated ETA. Seems also to have been bumped down which is meh. Can���t wait for the CSI survey.Maybe I should reconsider my purchase and just keep driving my car that���s still functionally going great and get one later down the track when the hype goes down.

Does anybody know what the recommend oil viscosity is for the Hybrid? The manual says 0W16 but 5W30 is also acceptable, which ones do the dealership use?
Milano Red writes...The manual says 0W16 but 5W30 is also acceptable, which ones do the dealership use?Indeed the manual says 0w16. I think the vehicle is manufactured for a number of countries across the world as be the recommended oil is usually for the coldest place. Which is the reason why it has a viscosity rating of 0 when cold. It basically means, the flow is higher in cold weather. Ensure that you also look at the operating temparature below the table as the X-axis.For Australian conditions and what I do on my current Camry is go for 5w30 during winter and 10w40 in Summer. If I was in Canberra, would have done 0w40 throughout because of the cooler weather compared to Sydney. By the way, always go for Full Synthetic. Nothing else, especially with these modern cars.Now, the dealers get their oil in bulk and would typically go for 0w30 or 0w40. The so called genuine Toyota Motor Oil is Castrol Magnatec non-synthetic for most part. The reason why they go for 0w30 or 0w40 is because it works for most or all cars they will service. It is the most universal range.

As you mentioned,  I think it could very well be the different bowser fittings in the USA that are causing early shut off.
From what I read, it may actually be the gauge fault, not that the tank is not getting filled up.People tried driving from when the gauge indicates 0 miles left, and they could get another 100miles "on empty" before running out. When they filled up then, it seems that the car takes whole 14.5 gallons, which is the fuel tank capacity.

https://www.carsales.com.au/cars/details/2019-toyota-rav4-cruiser-auto-efour/OAG-AD-18488322/?Cr=0Yikes!$60k You would have to be joking.
I've noticed on Carsales there is a number of Rav4 hybrids advertised as 2nd hand with 5-10000 kms on them by dealers at higher than new prices. Seems strange, can't see people trading in their new Rav4's that early
They're probably trying to capitalise on impatient customers not wanting to wait.Which is funny, because I guarantee if these customers put in the hard yards they could easily find a RAV4 in stock due to a cancelled order. Just takes patience and phoning hundreds of dealerships.
dad writes...can't see people trading in their new Rav4's that earlyCould be fully optioned demos.  Sales staff at our local dealer drive hybrids, but they would hold them longer than that.
blutek writes...Could be fully optioned demos.Doesn't look like anything has been added on externally from that photo. If it had additional options I'm sure they'd put it on the ad.FWIW that car has an RRP of $50k DA. Given the 15k km's on it and the year's depreciation that's already hit it (not to mention a year's warranty already gone + probably a third of its tyres gone) I wouldn't pay anything over high $30k's, esp considering a 2020 one can be had for $46k with production speeding up to ~4 months.

Golf3000 writes...Not for hybrid cruisers. Still 6-12 months.I ordered mine ( Cruiser AWD Hybrid)  on 11th Feb and it will be available for collection next week. It was not a cancellation. The dealer simply swapped colour with another dealer who was expecting one on the same shipment. I guess one can sometimes just be lucky.
I just picked up my new RAV4 Hybrid GXL AWD, yay!  Just under 4 weeks from putting down the deposit until pick up, lucky as. Silver, with tint and floormates, for $42,365.And I nearly sold it immediately. When I was picking it up there was a couple wanting to buy one and I was joking ��� I'll sell you mine for $50k, they were actually very interested, haha.But... there is one thing ....  I just can't find anywhere; in the manual, in the menus in the car itself ... and thats the illumination level of internal control buttons and knobs.This is NOT the illumination level of the instrument panel, but rather illumination of all the other blue backlit buttons, such as the head unit buttons and knobs, the air-conditioner display and knobs, and the central console things that are backlit.A few months ago I had the very same model for a weeknd (dealer demo) and I remember finding it somewhere, and I know it was at some illogical place, but for the life of me I can't find it now.The ODO pin on the instrument panel doesn't do this, it only affects the instrument panel illumination and there is no illumination scroll wheel down-right.Where the heck is this setting changed???Oh, also, is there a setting somewehre, maybe in the service menu, to change the backlight from blue to red or orange?I have very, very light sensitive eyes and the blue light is the worst in my case, red would be perfect. The current illumination levels are insanely strong for me at night.
Refer to page 66 of the manual.
Nothing there, that's all about the the warning lights on the instrument panel. :-(
I've just did a test drive of Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. I've just sold my Tiguan Highline and naturally that's my banchmark. RAV4 is not as premium which I was expected a little but still surprised me because:- It's  full of hard plastic, dashboard, doors, center console etc. I don't want to see this much plastic in a $50k car,- The hard plastic used is flimsy, shake centre console it moves, plastic used on the doors so thin it's springy when pushed,- It's not fun to drive and engine is not as responsive as Tiguan 162TSI, - The centre screen seems from 1990s, small, low resolution and buttons around the screen are primitive.- Sunroof, seats, stitches, mirrors, electronic dashboard, whereever you look at is all lower grade.I really wanted to like it but test drive was a bit of a let down. However, the family liked it (because the test car was blue!!!) and it's mainly gonna be driven by the wife so maybe I should stop comparing with Tiguan!
May I ask why you sold your Tiguan Highline?
The novated lease was expiring.  Rather than returning it to lease company and getting the wholesale value for it I sold it privately and made extra $$$.
Sharp�� writes...naturally that's my banchmarkI don't think you're comparing apples to apples. The Tiguan Highline (with the R Line and sunroof upgrade to equalise the RAV4) will end up costing $62k, about 25% more expensive than the RAV4.I do agree that it's quite plasticy especially on the exterior... this was the first thing I noticed. But I'm willing to turn a blind eye on it in favour of the incredible fuel economy as it's a hybrid and reliability of Toyota... these are the real points of differentiation for the RAV4 imo.
Mr F writes...I don't think you're comparing apples to apples. The Tiguan Highline (with the R Line and sunroof upgrade to equalise the RAV4) will end up costing $62k, about 25% more expensive than the RAV4.I paid $54k for mine without R line.On the same day, we also tried CX-5 and CRV. They all have advantages and disadvantages but in terms of interior trim quality RAV4 was the worse. Even if Toyota doesn't see VW as a competitor they still have a lot to learn from Mazda. I guess my disappointment is partly because I wasn't expecting this low quality material after seeing the internet hype on this car.
Wise decision!!
Sharp�� writes...I paid $54k for mine without R line.But that's still 20% dearer than the RAV4 (I paid $45k DA). If I had a bigger budget I'd be looking at the Lexus ��� best of both worlds (reliability and quality of materials).seeing the internet hype on this car.People normally assess a car holistically as a whole package. I imagine the hype means consumers have decided that given the price point, the pros outweighs the cons for the Rav4. (As someone who has placed a deposit on it, I can think of several things I don't like about it, but unfortunately I don't have a big enough budget to lessen them :)
Sharp�� writes...I've just did a test drive of Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. I've just sold my Tiguan Highline and naturally that's my banchmarkInteresting you say that. I drove a Rav 4 Cruiser and then half an hour later, a Tiguan Comfortline (with the leather package) and both my wife and I said the opposite. The Tiguan appeared to have the cheap plastic feel and the twitchy handling. Although the Tiguan did feel more responsive on the throttle. I had to laugh and walk away when the dealer told me it was $48k for the comfort line with the leather + safety packages and cash didn't have an effect on the price.
Sharp�� writes...I've just did a test drive of Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. I've just sold my Tiguan Highline and naturally that's my banchmark. RAV4 is not as premiumWe looked at Tiguan AllSpace and RAV4 Cruiser AWD. We've owned/own a range of VW group cars (I drive an Audi).Agree the dynamics on the Tiguan are better than the RAV4 (and certainly having owned various VW group cars the feeling is very familiar). We found though the RAV4 is a much more pleasant car to drive around day-to-day ��� the electric boost from zero is much handier and the suspension whilst not as "driver oriented" is really nice over most of the roads near us. The "grade of materials" I guess is what $12k price difference buys you. Given I have kids and this car will be our road trip car I'm less fussy about some of that.Admittedly the big decision point for us is that the RAV4 had a higher roof in the back seats. Me and my son are tall (13 year old who's 6'1") and both of us didn't fit properly in the Tiguan.Another big thing was running costs. RAV4 is substantially cheaper to run ��� servicing is a fraction of the VW group cars and less and cheaper fuel (option to do RON91).
���SSSK writes...I had to laugh and walk away when the dealer told me it was $48k for the comfort line with the leather + safety packages and cash didn't have an effect on the price.It actually has. Not to your liking, tough.Bringing cash to a car dealer is not a benefit at all. Dealers want you to finance through them, so that they can charge you the loan establisment fee ($500-1500), dealer comission ($500 ��� 1500) and have some kick backs from the interest rate. Ifn most cases there is a mnthly account eeping fee, the king of all cons, that the deler also gets some incentives.Whe you go to buy a car, negotiate the price without any discussion of the payment method. If they ask you how do you want to pay, just say ��� I'll think about it, but I want to know the price of the vehicle first. If they don't want to negotiate, you walk away (to talk to a competitor) and they'll drag you back with OK, OK, let's talk.
Question for RAV4 GXL owners ��� when you look down right where the fuel tank and bonnet opening switches are, there should be a high beam button. Do you have the interior light control dial next to it?This is the dial that controls the illumination of all the knobs, buttons, steering wheel controls (but not the instrument panel)?If you do, is your car 2019 or 2020 build?The problem I have is explained here whrl.pl/Rf1hMO
RommeI writes...This is the dial that controls the illumination of all the knobs, buttons, steering wheel controls (but not the instrument panel)?The current generation RAV4 has never had a rheostat-type control for dimming backlight switches.

Been tracking this forum for a while and thought i would share my experience waiting for the Rav4.I'm based in Perth and picked up my AWD Cruiser Hybrid on the 26th of Feb. Ordered in late September 2019 so a total wait time of 5 months. Found the wait very frustrating as the dealer gave me no new information from month to month. Eventually in mid Jan i called and asked to cancel the order and i got given a confirmed delivery for the end of Feb. Not sure if it was coincidental or if they just bumped us up the list at the expense of someone else.I've had the car for a week and in my opinion, it's well worth the wait. Drives and handles very smooth, have absolutely no issues with cabin noise which i was worried about as the 2019 one i test drove was a little thrashy under acceleration. Radar cruise control works great and so does Lane track assist. When on the freeway the car can literally steer itself, not that you should take your hands off the wheel but i found it to be an impressive feature given the price of the car. My only knock would be that you have to plug your phone in to the usb point to get Apple carplay working. I assume this is because it was a bit of an afterthought but it's not that big of an issue. Also like the feature where the car seems to read the speed signs on the side of the road and then displays the speed limit on the screen.After a week of driving in normal mode I'm averaging 5.4L/100km which to me is amazing given the size of the car. I assume this would improve in Eco however, i find the power under acceleration is a little less when in Eco mode so I just leave it in Normal mode.All in all it was a frustrating 5 month wait but I'm very happy with the end result and would highly recommend the hybrid.
Hi Folks.I have a Crusier Hybrid that has carplay etc. Problem is that the head unit is asking to do some app updates ��� and I accept, it downloads and asks for the OK to install and everytime it tries to install the update, it fails at around the 50% installed mark. This is all being stated on the display of the head unit. It is not related to carplay, I beleive it is something to do with the Toyata branded app ��� but no matter what I try, the update stalls.Anyone else had this and can they suggest a solution? Otherwise will need to pop into a dealer service centre I presume.
LeroyLoggins writes...My only knock would be that you have to plug your phone in to the usb point to get Apple carplay working.BMW has a wireless Carplay option, I believe, but most manufacturers do not. My own suspicion is that this is possibly because of the potential heavy battery usage with some Carplay apps although with the RAV4's wireless charging, this should not be a problem. I agree that it would be a nice to have but I've now had Carplay in a couple of vehicles and plugging the phone in eventually becomes a habit just like putting on a seatbelt.

Strats101 writes...Anyone else had this and can they suggest a solution?

chillemi writes...You shouldn't have to install anything, thats for the stupid Toyota App SuiteWhen you first connect to CarPlay, it will show an app specific to your vehicle. It will be called Volkswagen, BMW etc and  it will appear on the Carplay apps screen and also in the Carplay Customise settings (in settings/general on your iPhone). perhaps this is the app that it is trying to download/update. As a general rule, I always try to have my phone connected to my home network when I first use CarPlay in case there���s any downloads but this shouldn���t be necessary.
Strats101 writes...Problem is that the head unit is asking to do some app updates ��� and I accept, it downloads and asks for the OK to install and everytime it tries to install the update, it failsYeah mate.

LeroyLoggins writes.... Also like the feature where the car seems to read the speed signs on the side of the road and then displays the speed limit on the screen.Dunno if you���ve switched it on but RSA -Road sign assist while using dynamic cruise control is great. It���ll pick up the latest speed sign while using cruise and you can toggle up to go to the increased new limit, or toggle down if the speed limit has dropped. And it will change to the new posted speed sign on cruise.
What are the owners thought of the Reverse camera quality? Both myself and wife think the picture quality and resolution is very poor specially in the daylight with the sun reflections? I will point it out at the 1000 km service hoping it's a faulty unit. Can it be fix or updated through the dealer in future if that was the case?
With the ongoing delay with RAV4 Hybrid, I have been looking at alternate options and then came across Lexus NX300H, the only other Hybrid SUV brand in the market. The new one is $65k which is outside of my budget but 3 to 4 years old model seem to be available for ~45k range in Carsales. Did anyone compare these two models and do you have any feedback to share? Also, is NX300h a worthy alternate to RAV4? I do understand that Lexus is a luxury brand and its exterior and interior are superior to RAV4. Its car boot is small and middle seat in the rear seems to be bad. Other than that, are there any reasons why I should avoid Lexus?In general, I'm not really comfortable with buying Luxury cars considering its high maintenance costs. However, I heard that Lexus's maintenance and spares are comparatively cheaper and not so expensive. Is that correct? Does anyone have feedback on the annual service price and the spares price for Lexus?
Lexus is nice but the infotainment system is such a letdown. When I test drove it the salesman suggested to just use voice control.For the price of a 4 year old Lexus without any warranty and a new RAV4 with 7 years warranty, you���d seriously be silly to pick the former.

Toyota���s dash cam is about $580 fitted for my quote. We didn���t anything except front tint for around $270. Was easy at the tome as they did it at the dealer and I know the bloke doing it so was going to be done well. The cam and paint protection we will think about.

Then 3 more for the hybrid bits of you get their annual health check from 7-10 years which I suspect is just checking the battery load to make sure the voltage is balanced between each cell. Easy enough to do through torque app.

Easy enough to do through torque app.This is included in their servicing for free. But it means you'll need to pay Toyota's non-capped servicing price after the 5th year (every year until the 10th year), if you want the extended hybrid battery warranty. It's a smart way for Toyota to reel you back into getting servicing done at their dealers.

Tourist writes...What are the owners thought of the Reverse camera quality?It's rubbish. My wife has Honda CR-V and the difference is huge.
Mr F writes...It's a smart way for Toyota to reel you back into getting servicing done at their dealers.Yes, a big negative for me. I like working on my car and the warranty only covers the battery. Easy fix if it ever breaks, easy to monitor the health as you drive. Inverter is a harder piece to fix. But in general, batteries don���t just go bad. It just slowly degraded over time and with the right tools, you���ll learn to offload/budget for it before it breaks totally.
SmellyTofu writes...I like working on my car and the warranty only covers the battery. Easy fix if it ever breaksHow do you fix a battery? If it dies outside the warranty period I imagine you'll be in for a big expense.I agree that batteries rarely ever just die and I'm sure you can monitor it using an OBD meter (if you know what you're looking for).
Mr F writes...you'll need to pay Toyota's non-capped servicing priceCan get up there, our 120,000 km service was just quoted at $1,350 for previous model.

hi guys,Cruiser Hybrid FWDI am trying to find some final price regarding the settlement price. i know it gonna be a long wait.but RRP $47K in Melbourne,  wanna  see any buyer can get a better deal so i can use  as a reference to negotiate.  thank you.
Mr F writes...How do you fix a battery? If it dies outside the warranty period I imagine you'll be in for a big expense.HV Battery is made up of the individual cells which can be easily identified and replaced. Youtube has heaps of resources to do it.
ShyBoy writes...wanna  see any buyer can get a better deal so i can use  as a reference to negotiate.  thank you.Not in MEL, but see if you can find someone who can get a fleet price. That's how I got an okay discount. They matched a quote my brother got via work.
From Melbourne here. Put in a deposit in for a Cruiser Hybrid FWD for $45,406. Including floor mats, weather shields, tint x2 and a full tank. The guy at the dealership wasn't very willing to budge on price nor the extras, so it did take some time for them to finally agree to lower the price. I've read that others here have got an even better deal though.Ordered the car at the end of Jan, at the time I was told it was going to go into production in April and then would be ready sometime in May. Was then told today that the car would be arriving at the end of March and will probs be ready mid April. If it all does go to plan, I've definitely been lucky with the waiting period.

Our dealer told us they offer 7 years bumper to bumper warranty with proper servicing
Our August order ( cruiser hybrid white 2wd) is arriving at the dealer next week. Ordered 20 August, so just over 6 months. I would say extremely lucky with that order. Our dealer didn���t bluff initially he did say expect 6-9 month wait so we are stoked to finally have it in our hands next week. Mind you our car went into production the last week of January so he has been great keeping us updated
Just got the call from my dealer that the car is arriving very soon and I should be able to pick it up in about 10-12 days. Do they generally try and get the car ASAP or is it one of those things where it���s like they fit it in amongst other important stuff?
parkesyau writes...ur dealer told us they offer 7 years bumper to bumper warranty with proper servicingWeird. Wonder if it���s just your dealer or something ?? Ours is as mentioned 5 years and an extra 2 on drivetrain as mentioned.
needanewname19 writes...o they generally try and get the car ASAP or is it one of those things where it���s like they fit it in amongst other important stuff?I���m pretty sure they would have a good idea logistic wise of when your car is going to turn up, how long it will take to prep re accessories, rego  and such , to the point where it is ready for pick up. Just a matter of time. They thought ours would be ready at the end of a week on Friday , but messaged Monday morning ( the same week ) saying they had the car. They just needed to tint and prep and got a message Tuesday saying it was going to be ready for pick up after lunch.
Actually on a side note. To people who have received their cars. Are you happy with it overall ? Pet peeves ? Pros and cons ? Was it what you thought it would be and if not why not ?We got the petrol cruiser and while it���s no powerhouse I actually quite enjoy driving it. Look forward to a bit of a Sunday drive out of town. I���m a big bloke and for me still it is comfortable and has space to accomodate. Kids love it. Enjoy the sunroof but wasn���t a necessity. Stereo is great. Boot is spacious but will give it a good run on an upcoming holiday with regards to how much it can fit. Steering is nice and seems responsive and car handles the bumps of our local rural roads well.And I enjoy the tech that it has re the cameras and sensors and such for parking. Mind you our older car had none of this. What would you change if you had the choice ? Other than self closing side Mirrors!!   Keen to hear your thoughts overall.Our first new car purchase but it���s good to know I feel we made a good choice.
parkesyau writes...Our dealer told us they offer 7 years bumper to bumper warranty with proper servicingEither your dealer is going to pay for the repairs after 5 years of your car usage (which I don't believe) or you misunderstood him.  Standard terms of Toyota Warranty Advantage are: 5years b-2-b + extra 2years on Engine and Driveline (and perforation due to rust) if serviced as per the logbook (i.e. $210 capped services at Toyota every 1 year or 15000 km).Meaning that if, for example, your aircon breaks down after 6 years of use, it's you who will be paying for the repairs, not Toyota.Here is their T&C: https://www.toyota.com.au/-/media/toyota/main-site/page-data/warranty/files/toyota-warranty-advantage-terms-conditions.pdf?la=en

Wazza77 writes...To people who have received their cars. Are you happy with it overall ? Pet peeves ? Pros and cons ? Was it what you thought it would be and if not why not ?I've got GXL AWD Hybrid.Love almost all about it, but like with everything there are some cons.I don't like the inside door handles, they're too far to the front and difiicult to handle the door when in tight space or even worse when windy. There should be some sort of handle much further back. I still have my 2012 X-Trail, and it has perfect door handles. RAV4's handles suck.The central console is unnecessarily wide and takes too much leg room. I like to put my left foot close to the seat and flip my leg (knee) to the left, but it gives me no space (this is my top con).Storage space. Maybe because I'm coming from X-Trali which is king when it comes to this, but it seems that there is a bit of lack of storage space in the cabin, I'd prefer a 4-5 cm high slot just under or above the air-con controls.All the fuss about the car making various noises and clicks (such as when applying a brake) are not an issue at all. The road noise is audible, but just because the car is so quiet. Engine noise when revving up ��� not worse than any other CVT car.I picked up mine on Monday and it needs to go back for wheel alignment as it wans't done, or wasn't done properly prior to delivery, the car pulls slightly to the left.The low-beam headlights were also set awfully low to the point that I had to drive with high beam most of the time last night.  I did adjust them myself this arvo and now they are spot-on.No lumbar support adjustment on GXL ��� sucks.One thing that also sucks, but it sucks on most cars except on their top-end models, is that the seat angle is not adjustable, it's always a bit too much drop at the back, I like the seat being a bit flatter.The horn sounds like it's something from Toys 'r' us, I'll be getting Hella replacements off Amazon soon.The space in the back seat is ��� amazing. My daughter (18) who is a natural born whinger when it comes to space in the car said "Wow, you can play cricke here!"Am I the only one that thinks the leather steering wheel doesn't really feel like leather?Infotainment system is average at best.Rear view camera image quality is poor, but ... and there is a big BUT ... the night vision on that camera is phenomenal. The image quality is not good, but the high ISO exposure is top notch. Photographer here, so other photographers will know what I mean when I say it's like Sony A7S (exposure, not quality)Side mirrors are beautiful and in perfect spot. Inside rear view mirror ��� too close for my liking, but it's the shape of the car that dictates its placement.I put in the dash cam today (Viofo A119), it took me less than 10 minutes. The placement is not ideal, but again ��� it's the shape of the car.Fuel consumption so far (over 350 km) is 5.2l/100km, driving around Brisbane, mostly 60km/h zone and some small suburban streets. My 2012 Extrail 2.0 turbo diesel did 9.3l doing the same.I could write for the rest of the night, but you get the picture. All in all it's a really, really nice car and I'm very happy with it.

Nice summary Rommel. Cheers for taking the time.Yes to the door handles , I���ve noticed it in my tight shed.Yes to the centre console. Could be a bit slimmer , not a major for me. The base of the seat is good for me as I got the cruiser. It���s one of the reasons I went this way. I like it in a particular spot. Yeah the horn is not as ���macho ��� as my VY clubby !Kids also do love th e space in the rear. My daughter is near 5 ft 8 and 13 so enjoys the room and has space to grow.Understand what you mean re the ISO. Have worked , and still do, in a photographic lab for 20 plus years ( yes we still do exist !). But in this note I actually haven���t driven the car yet at night despite having it for 6 weeks. My misso usually has it.
RommeI writes...I put in the dash cam today (Viofo A119), it took me less than 10 minutes.I've got one of those too, did you do a permanent install? Any guides on routing the cables?
Does the Toyota RAV4 hybrid have a lithium or nickel metal hydride battery?
You know you can Google word for word what you typed and you���d get the answer?
Nickel metal hydride
My dealer told me today he was expecting a cruiser update next week ��� so for those waiting it might be useful to contact your dealer this time next week.I also asked about cancellations and he said they were "far and few between".Also I don't know if it's allowed to mention here, but FYI a group of us started a facebook group "Australians waiting for RAV4s" here ��� https://www.facebook.com/groups/2921809104543087/
I did google it trying to find something concrete from Toyota���s website to no avail. Specification sheets and brochures.https://youtu.be/tnJem4Uk0wk experienced Toyota mechanic  says the newer cars now have the lighter longer lasting lithium battery which contradicts other articles I���ve read.

The Toll tag is on top and the dash-cam is right below.I ran the cable to to top of the windshield, then under the roof lining (the gap is already there, all the way to the left, then down, between the dashboard and the door, then underneath the glove-box, then a bit up to go over that piece of plastic  that's on the side of the air-con switches, then back down again along the left side of the air-con switch and down to the cigarette lighter.I plugged it in using the USB adapter, didn't hard wire it.The cable is tucked under the lining and dashboard plastic all the way and it's not visible anywhere.

Range says another 80kms to go, so pretty impressive so far.One other thing which I just noticed is that there are actually lights on the side mirrors which come on at night when you open your door for vision as you step out of the car.Camera at night is great and we have been using android auto and it's great, Spotify, Waze google maps, it's great.One other thing is the statistics on the trip history are not very informative, the bar graph don't show you the exact fuel consumption. There must be a better way to display this information... otherwise we are super happy with the ride quality, noise etc.1st service coming up next week or week after!
My RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser AWD is almost ready for delivery. I���d be interested in knowing what fuel people are using in their Hybrid. My initial thought is that I will use E95 or similar even though the specifications state that 91 is fine. What are current owners��� experiences?
I���m running 91 in mine. Some times if Costco has 98 at a good price I use that. Have just over 11k on the clock.

The car doesn't need a power socket to charge...It charges during everyday driving... I don't have a rav4 hybrid but have had hybrids in the past and absolutely love the hybrid powertrain.... It is absolutely worth the extra money....

Nellyxy writes...I don���t understand this whole hybrid thing.I don���t want a car that needs charging!The point is you don���t need to understand other than it saves you fuel, it goes much faster than the non hybrid RAV4 but it cost a bit more.For the user, all you need to do is to fill it up, stick it into drive and go. The car manages the battery and everything. You literally can forget that it even has a battery or hybrid bits as that was the objective of the engineers was to not need any nerding out with hypermiling through power and glide techniques yet still get super good fuel economy.

Good luck with that one, I have been trying for weeks. Phoned them, even wrote them a letter (genuine snail mail) without any luck. Apparently if your salesperson doesn���t thick the right box at the time of sale you���re stuffed! If they do then you���re supposed to get an email with the codes. Obviously their IT systems are unable to cope with the simple task of backdating, doesn���t say much for Toyota Australia. The alternative is they can���t be stuffed.
I can't speak on behalf of the processes involved but my dealership was great. Sent them an email and they responded in a few hours with the codes. You might want to try someone else if possible, including their manager. They have no incentive to not give it out as it'll save them time ��� instead of updating you everytime you call, you can check yourself.To be fair, it's not much use. The tracking site (if you had it) will show "Order placed" and will be stuck with that same status for literally 5-6 months. Then it'll show "production scheduled" then "in production" for a week ��� this info will be obtainable from your dealership anyway. Some people have even missed it as the status changed so quickly.If you don't have it you can set a reminder to contact your dealer for a manual update after 6 months.
SmellyTofu writes...The point is you don���t need to understand hybrid other than it saves you fuel, it goes much faster than the non hybrid RAV4 but it cost a bit more.Exactly this.

I'm trying to consolidate a list of stuff that can only be done at the dealer. Anything else apart from these?- key fob wind down windows when unlocking (actually debating if this is going to cause more annoyance but)- key fob resets seat memory positions- disabling boot noise- Any thing else?
What's the boot noise?��� Ask if the accent light can be changed to red or orange and if the brightess can be reduced.
RommeI writes...What's the boot noise?The boot door opening can be turned down, but not off. If you want it off, it's a dealer configured thing.
Did anyone test drive or consider the Honda CRV when looking to buy? I really like the look of the RAV4 on the outside but on the inside they seem so basic for a car of that price. I like the interior of the CRV. Looking for a car is driving me crazy. Reading reviews makes it even worse!
You don���t get adaptive cruise, AEB, etc in the CRV except the top grade. It���s all included on all RAV4. That���s before you get into the oil dilution on any direct injection only engine.

So shouldn���t be annoying as you can decide if you just want to u lock the car, or press and hold to unlock and put windows down.key fob resets seat memory positionsThis can be done yourself.  Doesn���t need to be done at dealer. It���s in the manual.
Nellyxy writes...Excuse my complete ignorance but are these things really necessary?Aren't you the one saying the RAV4 was "basic"? Yet old mate demonstrated to you it's far from basic.Anyway the RAV looks much more pleasing to the eye than the CRV which I think looks a bit like a van especially from the back.
Nellyxy writes...Did anyone test drive or consider the Honda CRV when looking to buyYes, we did.  I loved the interior of the CRV, and also thought it drove well (we were looking at the V-Ti S).  However ��� when I did some research online, there were lots of people complaining about the head units failing due to overheating in the sun, and comments about how they were not designed for the Australian climate.  There were a few other quality complaints I found, but I can't remember what they were about now, but the head unit was the one that concerned us the most.  We live in QLD, and so the car will be living in hot conditions (garaged at night obviously but during the day when we're out and about we couldn't guarantee it would be undercover or away from the sun) ��� so we decided against it.   We also loved all of the features that the RAV4 had as standard.Re the interior of the RAV looking basic ��� I would agree that it doesn't have quite the 'wow factor' as the interior of the CRV.  However ��� when you compare it to other mid size SUVs such as the Kia Sportage or Hyundai Tuscon, its miles ahead of those interiors.  For me, the screen placement and the centre console being well laid out and functional were the key must-haves,  along with looking sleek, and the RAV4 meets all of these requirements easily.We've had our RAV4 for about 2 weeks now, and couldn't be happier.  Its a dream to drive, the interior is comfortable and well laid out, and we have absolutely no regrets with our purchase!
Nellyxy writes...Excuse my complete ignorance but are these things really necessary?I don���t trust anyone���s driving to not run over me when you don���t stop.Also the gear can be upgraded to a level 2 self driving function.
We tested a CRV VTi-L and liked the ride and the performance in the city. It is spacious too but also felt bigger than the RAV to drive.What I didn't like was the cabin noise on the highway. It appeared to be quite boomy and the doors closed with less of a thunk than what I expected. I also have reservations if it will be powerful enough on the highway with 4 people and luggage for a holiday on board. It didn't feel like it had the reserves of power of the RAV on the highway.We've owned a Thai built Honda Jazz for the past five years (our second Honda) and although its never been unreliable, its had its fair share of niggles, so my biased preference is for a Japanese built Japanese car.For the test drive, the displayed fuel consumption was above 9.7l/100km, with a mix of highway and city. The RAV for basically the same test route was 5.6l/100km.The CRV's interior is nice but I wouldn't put it above the Cruiser. I ordered a Silver Sky Cruiser Hybrid AWD with black leather instead.Ordered on 24 Feb 2020 and the order quotes the build date as 15 April 2020, although the dealer told me 6 to 8 months wait. Going on people's experiences here, we'll wait and see. Got $1,500 discount on RRP, so a smidge under $48k drive-away, with metallic paint, carpet mats, 12 months rego, full tank, $100 fuel card (PriceMyCar referred me) and no trade-in.
A question for those who already have their cars, is Silver Sky a bright silver or more of a grayish silver? The dealer didn't have a silver one to show us and online photos aren't really conclusive.

Suachris writes...or more of a grayish silverMine is more grayish than bright.
https://comma.ai/Plenty of proven comparisons vs Tesla's autopilot from users particularly using TSS2.0 gear.
To me they are safety features, which have the added benefit of being convenient. It is a bit like asking if airbags are necessary. They're not, until you need them. If you've had somebody stray into your lane on a highway or see them barreling down on you in your rear view mirror because they have cruise control on and distracted by something, you'll wish they had it and therefore could need it one day too.
That's good news, thanks.
Suachris writes...A question for those who already have their cars, is Silver Sky a bright silver or more of a grayish silver?It's closer to pure silver than grey. Toyota HR-V has a perfect silver-grey colour, not sure of the name, but it's exactly how I would like my car to look like. But my RAV4 is SkySilver and it's okay, not too bright.
I know the vehicle tracking system very well. Just to be clear. 1. It was never designed to work in WA as they have an   independent distributor. 2. It was only ever designed to work for private sales and small fleet purchases. (Large fleets have access to a different system). 3. It is dependent on the dealer creating a retail order in TMCA's system. (no order no tracking). 4. The dealer at any time can activate / deactivate tracking of a particular order. 5. It is difficult but not impossible to track a vehicle that is being swapped in to fulfill a customers order but this is dependent on both dealers agreeing. 6. A batch is either created when the retail order is created or the order is attached to an existing batch. 7. A dealer can swap an order from one batch to another batch but most dealers just cancel the order and create a new one. This creates issues if they have already given out the order number.  The reasons as to why dealers are not responsive to requests to track a vehicle 1. They don't create a retail order in TMCA's system until they get a batch with confirmed production. 2 They keep adding/deleting the retail order as batch numbers change. 3. The vehicle has been sourced from another dealer and doesn't appear in your dealer's pipe until it has been invoiced to the dealer. 4.Ignorance  on how the system works (or just lazy).
Thanks for the input about the CRV���s. I used to own a Toyota Corona then a Toyota Seca coupe and absolutely loved both so it���s definitely a brand that I have faith in.I was driving a Subaru Forester 2017 until it was in an accident and now I need to replace it. I assumed I���d just get another one but want to keep my options open. The RAV4 did seem quite pricey unless it���s the base model. Would anyone recommend maybe getting a 2-3 year old more premium model? Sorry for all these questions but buying a car is certainly not an easy task! Especially at the 30-34k price point.
Nellyxy writes...Did anyone test drive or consider the Honda CRV when looking to buy?I really like the look of the RAV4 on the outside but on the inside they seem so basic for a car of that price.I have both.I have RAV4 GXL AWD Hybrid now and my wife has Honda CR-V VTi-S, that I used to drive for quite some time.So here is a quick comparison from my point of view.Looks outside ��� fom the frot, both cars look amazing, maybe a very slight edge to CRV. From the back RAV4 looks great, Honda looks quite awful, big fat ass momma :-)Looks inside ��� Honda is somewhat better looking, but not by much. If Toyota worked a bit more on the inforainment system look, it would win it for me. This way is 55:45  in favour of CRV.Talking about the infotainment piece, RAV4 placement is better when you need to look at it while driving, but Honda's easier to reach. RAV4 has buttons that are easier to deal with when driving, Honda relies on touch screen and it can be pain and distractive.Blind spot monitoring ��� RAV4 has it on both sides and it shows a glowing icon in side mirrors. Honda has it only on passinger side, but it has a camera in the passenger side mirror that turns on as soon as you turn on the left indicator and shows you the live view on the infotainment screen. I LOVE this.RAV4 inside door handle looks nice but it's too far to the front and it's pain in the ass to controll the door swing when in tight space or when windy, Honda's one is perfect.If you like to sit like me, and that's to pull your left foot all the way back close to your seat and flip your knee to the left, Honda is slightly better. CRV central console is a bit narrower and gives you a bit more space there but you'll have a bump under your foot. With RAV4, the console is wider, but the floor is flat under your foot.Honda's fabrics door lining picks up any dead cells on your skin (elbows), or traces of make up foundation on your wife (daughter, girfriend, mum) fingers and requires constant attention (cleaning), RAV4 plastic, is better.Seats on both are equally good and comfortable, really nothing between them.Rear view camera ��� during the day Honda's camera is slightly better, at night RAV4s camera takes the honours, and then some. At total dark and with your reverse lights on ��� it's spectacular. Honda's is between so-so and meh.Rear bench space great in both cars. RAV4 rear door opening angle is like any other car/suv, on CRV it's almost 90 degrees, something you'll love if you often have small kids / baby seats or elderly people in your car.Boot, about the same. CRV VTI-S has power door at the back, something I've learned to hate. It's slow and painful to wait, my RAV4 GXL has normal boot door and I like it better that way.Noise ��� road, engine, wind ��� no difference in my opinion. Probably when coasting RAV4 is a bit quieter as you really can't hear the engine at all. When you push them hard, RAV is a bit louder, but we're splitting hairs here.Driving performance ��� I think RAV4 is somewhat livelier, although Honda is just fine as well. I had some doubts before I bought it 2 years ago, but having had Golf VI and VII with 1.4 Turbo engines I was comfortable with it and it performs well.Highway speed and grunt with car full of people and holiday gear ��� neither of them is Golf GTI and you don't want to push it with your dearest all in the car anyway. Which one is better in that sense ��� probably RAV4, but only slightly.Handling, steering, cornering ��� all about the same. Honda's brakes are very touchy, you just put your foot on it and it bites really hard before you even press, RAV4 is a bit more civilised.I would say so far they are really on par, total draw score, but then ...Things that Honda lacks and RAV4 has:Active cruise control, collision avoidance system that looks for cars, pedestrians and cyclists, road sign recognition camera (reads the speed limit and shows it in your dashboard and can warn you if you're going too fast, if you want so), rear side radars, when reversing and somoene is coming from the side and camera doesn't see it, the radar does. Go to Bunnings car park for 10 minutes and you will appreciate this thing no end. Then there is lane departure warning and steering correction, auto high beam management ... I'm sure there are quite a few other safety things on this list, Honda has none. All these things added up make a big difference.Honda has speed limiter, though, I don't think RAV4 has it.  RAV4 has puddle light, this is the light that is in the bottomo f your seide mirrors, super handy at night. I didn't even know about it until a few days into ownership.Now let's talk about Hybrid. It's so damn nice to drive, soo seemless and such a clever system. Fuel consumption difference between the two cars is night and day.I drive from SW suburbs of Brisbane to West End to work every day. 50km round trip.Honda's consumption was constantly 7.9l/100km (measured over long period). I had Xtrail diesel in recent months and that one was averaging 9.3l/100km for doing the exactly same.RAV4 so far, and I don't see a reason why it would change, is 5.1l/100km.Take that ��� almost 40% more fuel efficient than CRV and almost 50% better than Xtrail diesel.In marketing language ��� Honda needs almost 60% more fuel to travel the same distance.So if I could keep only one of these two cars now, it would be RAV4 without hesitation.
Nellyxy writes...Would anyone recommend maybe getting a 2-3 year old more premium model?RAV4 ��� no. The previous model is rubbish when compared to CRV. Before I bought CRV I compared RAV4, Xtrail, CX5 and Tiguan and RAV4 came dead last.Just open the door and look inside, it looks like something from 2003.Especially at the 30-34k price point.In that case you must go and see KIA Seltos. We had it for a weekend and my wife is tempted to sell CRV and get new Seltos, not the entry level model, but the one just above.It's one hell of a car, although slightly smaller than RAV4 or CRV, but not as small as HRV, CH-R or Qashqai. I was considering it myself, but in the end I wanted a hybrid.
I hated the gear shift mounted on the dash board on the CRV. That alone made me rule it out.Disclaimer: I ended up with a Tiguan.
Nellyxy writes...Would anyone recommend maybe getting a 2-3 year old more premium model?You're comparing chalk and cheese. But if you're wanting luxury and your budget works with a previous generation (40 series) Cruiser, look at only the 2.5L 2AR-FE, not the problematic diesel.
Rommel thanks for your very thorough comparison. They both seem like they���re quality cars.There���s so much to think about and everytime I read a review it just throws a spanner in the works. That���s why at first I was just going to get another forester as it���s what I know and it was fine. Not the most glamorous car but still good. Another contender is the Honda Civic coupe. I know it���s not an SUV and nothing like the RAV OR CRV but I like it nonetheless.
phoneyhuh writes...I hated the gear shift mounted on the dash board on the CRV.Yeah, that is a bit odd but also a feature of CRVs. I didn't mind it, but thought it could be a smaller stick, haha.I liked Tiguan at the time, but servicing cost was out of this world and interior was 10 year old, same as my 2009 Golf VI. Honda had 7 yr warranty and capped service, so that swayed it for me.
Nellyxy writes...There���s so much to think about and everytime I read a review it just throws a spanner in the works.Go to the dealer on Saturday at 3pm and ask for a test drive ( Honda this week, Toyota the next, KIA one later). When done, ask if you could hire this model somewhere for a weekend, you'd like to have a better feeling of what the car is really like before you commit. In alsmost all cases the deler will let you have their demo over the weekend and to bring it back on Monday morning (as they're closed on Sunday, at least here in QLD). I did that soo many times, it's not funny. But you do get a good feeling for a car when you have it for a couple of days, rather than 30 min test drive.I cannot stress enough how good the KIA Seltos is, do yourself a favour and take one for a drive and read a bit about it, it's a real gem.

RommeI writes...I liked Tiguan at the time, but servicing cost was out of this world and interior was 10 year old, same as my 2009 Golf VI.Servicing is $2250 for 5 years / $450 a year.

Enjoying my new 2WD Cruiser Hybrid except for the constant "speeding" alerts.

Are there any other places I need to change this?

I wish tehre is just a chime, that would be perfect.Go to Menu, Navigation and look under advanced speed settings. You can set the threshold or turn it off.I did set it to warn me if I go 12 over the limit, so not to be bugged all the time, but every time I turn into any shopping centre parkign lot the chick goes off. So I kiilled it off and only left it at 12 over on highways.

section writes...Pick up estimated at 6 months in September, the long wait begins!Dealers are getting updates this week. Already one report in FB of further delays on cruisers so just expect that.
September 2019 order here. Another month, another delay. Now planned prod of May 2020. Getting close to the end of my six month extension on my current lease. If I get pushed one more month I might need to cancel my order as I am not extending again!
Still makes no sense these times, Black AWD Cruiser ordered 12th October and sitting on a ship for a week with what is said to be a 7th April at the latest collection.How people before me can still be waiting is just baffling.
when does the next Sydney shipment land? Our's should be on that.
Not sure, tried contacting the dealer to establish what ship it was on but they couldn't tell me.

Very true SmellyTofu, hasn't been without issues however.I spat it at the dealer last week after being screwed around on the trade in however lesson learnt on that front and the sheer lack of communication to date ��� 1 phone call in 6 months and that was only because of the 'price increase'.
I was told some years ago that manufacturers of mass produced cars produce them in colour batches as it simplifies changing over spray guns, cleaning equipment etc. Popular colours will have bigger batches more frequently. May exactly be colour difference; especially if your order just missed a colour run of your preferred colour.
My car is sitting at the dock and I know I'll get it soon enough but man this waiting is killing me. It's been months and this last week or so is just going so slowly.
needanewname19 writes...but man this waiting is killing me.Patience is a virtue,All good things come to those who wait,and so on and so forth.  But I'm hearing you. We were away when we heard our car was to arrive in town, and they would have it ready by the end of that week, BUT our sales rep was going to be away until the monday after and asked if we would mind waiting until then! I was like, we've waited 4 months and now its going to be sitting there ready , and you want us to wait till the week after! ( first world problems i know). But anyway, thankfully they had it ready early through that week, and we could pick it up when then.
Haha, I know, its just been 7 months so it's like cmon! I think the fact I know it's a driveable distance away is the problem.I'm really needing it to be ready before Thursday/Friday next week so I'm hoping they'll have it ready a couple of days earlier otherwise I'll have the same problem :(
needanewname19 writes...Haha, I know,You'll be right , you'll have it before you know it. With any luck your Estimated Pick up day is being generous to the dealer, and they may have it prepped before then. Also i spose it depends on what accessories and such you are having , and how far the car has to travel from the dock to your local dealer and such.Enjoy when you get it, I am. We didn't buy it as "drivers car " per se, ( i have others for that ) but have found I do quite enjoy driving it. It definately has ( to me ) more character than the tucson and the CX5 i drove.
"The final price was $43.3k with silmline weather shields, headlight protector, carpet mats and black silmline plates"@section, it seems to be a very good price, the lowest that I have heard. If it's a VIC dealer, then can you please indicate the dealer name.
Ordered on 8th Feb and picked up my Cruiser AWD Hybrid today. A few immediate changes required...1. Turn off automatic door locking2. Turn off school zone warnings (they were going off even outside school zone hours)3. Change over-speed warnings to 15kmh over the limit4. Turned off screen touch beepingApart from the above, all is excellent although I���ll almost certainly find new options to play with over the coming days.
It is great to see how happy people are with their new RAVs. Two things we didn't get to experience with the test drive of a Cruiser was the JBL sound and the ambient lighting. If you've had your Cruiser for a while, what's your opinion?
Suachris writes...Two things we didn't get to experience with the test drive of a Cruiser was the JBL sound and the ambient lightingI've only had minimal use of the JBL sound system so far (1 day) but I'm very happy with it. Great sound!
Suachris writes...Cruiser was the JBL soundI love it, bass is good and more than enough volume wise to crank some tunes!!  I've mentioned earlier in the thread I used to love a good stereo, but haven't worried too much over the last few years in my current car. But am pleasantly surprised and pleased with the JBL in the rav, my teenage daughters love it too. I enjoy a road trip again.On the ambient lights i haven't really been in it in the dark yet despite having it for 2 months!! BUt in the darkness of our shed they still dont seem very bright?? if thats the word. i had to double check it had the lighting!
I think I'm going to cancel my hybrid cruiser order.Contacted my dealer today. Production date pushed back yet another month to May. That's an "expected" production month that has been pushed back each and every month since January. In short, six months after ordering I still don't even have a production date.If it gets built in May that would mean a nine-month wait from order to delivery. But realistically with the virus I don't expect to see it inside of 12 months. Maybe longer.Edit: I set up a FB page for people waiting >> https://www.facebook.com/groups/2921809104543087/
I have found the ambient lighting gets the balance right so that you can see objects without the light being distracting, whilst night drivingThe sound quality from the JBL stereo is very good, but the system lacks internal storage so you need either to plug in a USB drive or use the same port to connect Apple Carplay or similar. That is frustrating.
grahampeters writes...you need either to plug in a USB drive or use the same port to connect Apple Carplay or similar.I���ve been using Apple CarPlay in a couple of vehicles now and have found it pretty much meets all my in-car entertainment needs when combined with an Apple Music subscription. I can simply press the ���speak��� button on the steering wheel and say ���play xxx��� where xxx is an artist, album or song etc. I���ve found that I no longer have any need for CDs or USB music sticks.

More power to you Littlelake. I know ppl have snagged cancellations after a lot of work ringing around. I am reluctant to cancel my order and ring around tho cos it seems unlikely I would be able to negotiate the same deal I got back in September.It does also seem to me that some dealers get preferential treatment over other dealers. If so ��� how are you supposed to know which dealer will turn around your order in a few months or even weeks ��� and which ones are closer to a year?Surely everyone in Australia should get a number when they order ��� and that number indicates your place in a single queue?
Golf3000 writes...Surely everyone in Australia should get a number when they order ��� and that number indicates your place in a single queue?That might be a sensible way to go but my understanding is that dealerships are given an allocation for each variety of vehicle irrespective of how many buyers they have. Sometimes they are lucky enough to be able to swap, say, a Hilux for a RAV4 etc with another dealership that has a particular order to fill. As above, I think it really comes down to getting lucky.

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30997060/2020-toyota-recall-camry-avalon-rav4-engine-cracks/The recall covers models with Toyota's 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and include the 2020 Camry, Camry hybrid, Avalon hybrid, 2019 and 2020 RAV4 and RAV4 hybrid, and the 2020 Lexus ES300H. In total, 44,191 vehicles are covered by the recall, the majority of which (36,920) are 2019 and 2020 RAV4 crossovers. All the vehicles were built between September and December 2019. The issue came about when a water flow meter that regulates the casting of engines failed, leading to some engines not cooling properly.
My car is at the dealership. Holy. It���s crazy this journey of waiting is coming to an end.I feel really horrible that more people are waiting even longer than I did for their cars. Its a shame they haven���t been able to figure out stock control.
Golf3000 writes...it seems unlikely I would be able to negotiate the same deal I got back in September.This would appear to be the problem.  There's no incentive for the dealer to do anything to expedite the process.....
Anyone know the ship that left I gather Singapore last week? Dealer is again useless, very much looking forward to the survey.
jnu123 writes...The recall covers models with Toyota's 2.5-liter four-cylinder engineThese cars were built in the US. Shouldn't affect Australian cars.
I'm very close to doing to same as Golf3000.Ordered at the start of September from an ACT dealership with an original estimated timeframe of no longer than 6 months (perfect as it would coincide with the end of my current lease). Fast forward 5 months(jan 2020) and they say it could take 6-9 months. I'm like ok, I suppose I could extend my lease by a further six months (which was a pain in the arse mind you) and hopefully I would get it by April/May.Now that my expected production date has moved yet again to May with no end in sight I will have to make a decision next month to either (a) cancel my order as i'm not extending my current lease again (2) call them and ask if they can arrange one of the 'while you wait' cars they promoted at the start of the year.

The school zone warnings are driving me crazy.

I have turned off school zones and safety zones in the options but it���s still occurring. Has anyone worked out how to turn this off?
I took one for a test drive on Monday and I got the School zone warning when I was nowhere near a school.

I turned it off but she was still talking, and i live around the corner from 3 schools!turns out i hadn't turned it off in the right section( only in a bit where you could vary the speed it popped up at). Know doubt someone will help you out but if not when I get home I will try and remember which actually section to go and turn it off properly is.
Wazza77 writes...turns out i hadn't turned it off in the right section( only in a bit where you could vary the speed it popped up at).Yes, I found the solution also. There are actually two places with School Zone settings. The second place is in "Driver Information" section and turning it off there resolved the problem.
We ordered our Atomic Red AWD Cruiser on July 31st and got it 20th February 2020. Adelaide SA. (Peter Kittle Toyota)204 days so just over 6 �� months. It is missing the power seat [edit: memory ones on the door] controls, due to be fixed in a couple of weeks at its first free service inspection,  but apart from that it was worth the wait.
I just got back from 15,000 km servicing.Been driving it since June/July,  loving each bit of it.
3RiC writes...I just got back from 15,000 km servicing.I���ve now done 200km. Does that count?

How true is that.People always very quick to jump on the social media bandwagon, attention and efforts should be focused elsewhere.No amount of whinging and sooking  on Facebook will change anything.
Do you suggest commenting on forums.Its not a whinge or sook, its undertsanding the process and if that correlates with what is being told. With such high demand, no dealer will hold you to an order when the car hasnt been made!
Got confirmation I am picking my car up next week.I don't think it's really fair to suggest everyone who is on fb or this forum who is  commenting and getting upset because a lack of communication is not going to change anything. More people are educated about the process than they were 48 hours thanks to that new FB group.As consumers, it is fair that you at least understand why something is delayed and why your dealer is too scared to communicate the bad news to you. People have plans, babies coming, trips ahead relying on this car being ready when they were advised and being delayed months and months doesn't justify you staying quiet.Let the people whinge. Let the dealers who have joined that group see it and hopefully make better choices when they communicate to new customers.

Littlelake writes...A few immediate changes required...1. Turn off automatic door lockingI have managed to unlock once the car is in park.How do you switch off automatic door locking?
The reason Toyota hasn���t communicated is coz they don���t have a process to manage this in the first place nor are they in the business to invest in this process as they probably don���t see this to be an ongoing issue. They are in the business to sell cars, have you drive off into the sunset and don���t talk to you again until service time if you���re lucky.Their email and SMS opt in/out system doesn���t even work and I could have nailed them many times in breach of the spam act over the course of 3 years.So yes I can be seen as whinging but having been one of those people, the employees don���t have the faintest clue what it���s like being a customer other than rely on dealer verbatim and the Toyota research system they use. Rarely anyone working in the office goes out and buys a car coz it���s all leased at a discount (0.66% of RRP per month) on a year by year basis.

Does the GXL hybrid have some kind of sensors for when people sit in them?  As I had a mate get in the back and I started to drive off and a notification popped up showing 3 shiloetts and in the position where he was seated it was blinking red.

Yeah he didn't.  But I can't find anything in the manual about it.

For the hybrid cruiser does BSM beep out loud?

Picked up our new rav 4 hybrid this week (white 2wd cruiser) was ordered 30th August 2019. All I can say for everyone waiting it���s SO WORTH THE WAIT. I am not a car person and I just love this car. Hang in there if you can!!! Dealer is saying that times will be closer to 8-9 months now with the whole Coronavirus dilemmas.  We got the white and it looks super swish with the black wheels and very dark windows. Don���t bother with the dealer tinted windows they come very dark anyway ( privacy dark and apparently if they were to be done here you Couldn���t get them that dark anyway) it���s just the driver and passenger that���s normal.Well done Toyota
parkesyau writes...Don���t bother with the dealer tinted windows they come very dark anyway ( privacy dark and apparently if they were to be done here you Couldn���t get them that dark anywayWhen people mention the dealer tint they are usually taking about the fronts.  We got ours done as I thought it looks odd having half the car tinted. And wanted them dark anyways.
Yes correct the front windows (driver and passenger) don���t come tinted. But dealer charging over $1k to ���tint��� all windows ( when the back are already really dark) is a bit of a stretch. Just going to get my front two done locally and cheaper.
parkesyau writes.... But dealer charging over $1k to ���tintMine was about 260 for the fronts. That was my quote  from dealer. Others were quoted more but I think at that stage the dealer didn���t even realise in the case that they came with the privacy glass, and should only be quoting on the fronts ( instead of quoting on a full tint )  Mind you I could have gotten it a bit cheaper than 260 locally but was happy to get the bloke at the dealer to do it and have it out of the road.  I also know the bloke doing it and know he does a good job.

Thanks Wazza77.I remember when testing a July 2019 GXL hybrid late last year, I was driving on a two carriage road in Brisbane and when I had another vehicle in or around the blind spot, the thing would flash (same as the car I have now; same car just build Jan/2020).However, when I turned on an indicator when the mirror sign is flashing (on that side) on that 2019 model, it would beep, but not on mine.

Having said that, maybe that can be changed through the menu, but I haven't tried as I am happy with such silent indication.Funny tho that it turns that yellow light off when my RAV4 is stopped (say at the set of lights). I don't know if I like that or not ��� I guess I always want to know if there is anyone in my blind spot. On the other hand ��� the road position of the other car, when my BSM indicator goes ON or OFF depends on the speed of both vehicles, so... I dunno...

I went to Waverley Toyota today to check if they would negotiate on price of Cruiser Hybrid 2WD. I was surprised when the salesman said that we must buy their paint, interior protection and tint package since they were selling it with every cruiser Hybrid. It was more than 3k last year but he was giving it to us for $2490. He quoted me $50,100 drive away with the protection package.  When I said I am only interested in the car, I was told that he will have to get his manager���s approval to remove the extra package. He then quoted me $47,500 for the car without the package. I showed him online price of $47,131 so he offered $47k. I told him why should I give him my business as any Toyota dealer would sell me car at the retail price and his answer was that he can get it before any other Toyota dealer. He also told me that I would end up loosing my deposit with any other dealer as they won���t be able to deliver the car within time frame of the contract and the same car would cost me a grand more because I will lose my deposit and come back to buy from them.

SmellyTofu writes...Gujju, did you already put down a deposit? coz that sounds like a predatory salesman.No, I didn't. I caught his bs the moment he said that every cruiser hybrid they sell must go with the extra package. He kept going on about how good the paint protection is and interior can be kept as new with the protect package without even asking if we were interested or not.

My local dealer, FT Gully Toyota was at least up front about the time frame and no negotiable price and didn't try to sell us anything extra.

Very seriously thinking of getting a Cruiser Hybrid 4wd and been to a few dealers and all quoting the same price ($49795), on road, and all have said I can put down $500 deposit and if I change my mind I get the deposit back. Anyone confirm this is correct, and there are no T@C's or small print involved. Bit worried about the stock-market crash but if things get real bad seems like a no brainer to me, put down a deposit, wait 4-6 months to see how the market goes, and then make a decision.
dad writes...and if I change my mind I get the deposit back. Anyone confirm this is correct,The standard vehicle purchase contract varies from state to state but there is usually an ���additional clauses��� section where you can include any mutually agreed condition(s) so the dealer should be OK with including a no penalty cancellation clause in there if they wish.

I���ve been searching many different RAV4 forums and still haven���t found any definitive results with respect to differences between fuel types. The RAV4 specifications state it will run on 91 octane but I���m probably going to use 95 unleaded (I���ve only had mine a couple of days and haven���t had to fill it up yet).Has any long term owner made any observations with respect to efficiency or performance with various fuels?
Given the thermal efficiency of the engine when using the 91RON fuel it is designed for (41% the most efficient of any engine currently sold in a passenger vehicle), I cannot see why you would waste money by putting more expensive fuel in it.
My first tank of fuel was 91, averaged about 5.3L/100km.  With the same driving style and similar daily route, my second tank of fuel 95 (half way through now) averages about 4.9L/100km.  I'll continue my experiment with 98 next, and then back to 91 again to reverify the results. :)
Littlelake writes...The RAV4 specifications state it will run on 91 octane but I���m probably going to use 95 unleaded (I���ve only had mine a couple of days and haven���t had to fill it up yet).The manufacturer tells you what fuel to use and you ignore it based on no evidence what so ever.

Obviously, you need a few tanks of each fuel type to get an average consumption but yours is a good start.grahampeters writes...Given the thermal efficiency of the engineYou may be right but it will be interesting to see other people's actual experiences. Like Matchaman, I intend to try a few different levels of fuel. I keep an accurate account of fuel consumption on all my vehicles and will see how my own results compare to that of others.
@LittlelakeI normally run 91 and get about 5.4l/100km. Every 5 or 6 tanks I put in 95. Some times Costco will have 98 (don���t have 95 in Queensland) for the price of 95 I will use that. I can���t see a big difference between the fuel types.
less polluting with 95, but that's getting offtopic so,/archive/2448933

Overall, I am getting about 5.6 l/100km without being over-careful in a Cruiser AWD Hybrid. It is very noticeable that the more stop-start city driving I do, the better the economy, the reverse of normal cars

GXL Hybrid, using ULP 91 RON so far 1790km and fuel average is 5.1l. Mix of suburban streets, a bit of highway and city fringes. The very same travel with 2018 CRV averages 7.9l over a few months and 9.3l with Xtrail diesel (2012).The slower the traffic is, the better fuel economy ��� more battery use. Highhway at higher speed adds wind resistance, adding quite a bit to fuel consumption.The other day I came home from South Brisbane (25km trip) at 3.9l average for the trip, although it was a dense traffic and quite a bit of stop-and go. Somewhere half way I was sitting at 2.9l (OK, I was really nursing it) but as I got on the 4 lane road, it sped up to 60-70km/h and got home at 3.9l.
Been driving my AWD hybrid Cruiser for a month now, and yes while generally it's rather quiet, I did find the engine noise to be rather intrusive in the following scenarios:- Sudden acceleration- Accelerating while going uphill- Occasionally when the engine switches from electric to petrol.  I'm still trying to figure out why sometimes it's so much louder.  I suspect when the engine is cold and it switches, the noise is a lot louder compared to when the engine is already warm after driving it for some distance. I'll continue to monitor it.
exactly my experience so far, I will continue to monitor and raise this to dealer on my first service/check up.
Hi..May I know how much you paid for the gxl petrol? Thinking of getting one in stock.TIA..

This "pay $500 deposit, refundable if you change your mind" deal.Does anyone know if there is a cut-off time limit on "changing your mind"Can it be up to the day you are supposed to take delivery, or maybe the day they start production.When I asked the sales guy he was a bit reticent on giving a clear answer, especially when I said I wanted the NutmegLeather Accented trim, as he said that wasn't very popular.

Oops sorry, couldn���t get the reply to post right.. thanks though :)
Thanks for your replies. That's what I was thinking, before signing I will ask to take the contract home and read every page before I sign.
Not only that, but also include any clause you want in the contract, e.g. "The buyer can at any point prior to delivery and for any reason cancel this contract and receive full refund on any deposit paid".Say you wait for six months already and new XTRAIl comes out and you love it, you just cancel this contract and go and buy the Nissan. (I was actually waiting for it, but it doesn't seem to be coming out this year and I was lucky to get RAV4 in 3 weeks from signing.Normally, most dealers would not accept this, but in RAV4 case they will, they want to sell the car and want to sign you up. If you bail, they'll sell the car in 10 minutes anyway, so not a big deal for them.After all it's a contract between two parties, you and them, so what ever both agree, that's what you sign.
My dealer told me in a friendly way that I'd be doing him a favour if I cancelled as 1) they'd still get allocated the stock and 2) they would sell it for more than the price agreed.
We went to two more dealers in South East Melbourne. One wouldn���t negotiate much on price of 2WD Cruiser Hybrid and was ready to sell at $46,700 (RRP $47,131). The other gave the same price and the salesman was happy to check if they can lower it further, will wait to hear back from him to see how much more he can discount it.  They said not to expect discount in thousands but only hundreds since the car is in demand. Is 45-45.5k achievable for this car or am I being too unrealistic?
Gujju writes...Is 45-45.5k achievable for this car or am I being too unrealistic?UnlikelyWhen they are selling like hot cakes and it���s a 6 month wait , if it���s not you signing the next person to come along will pay it

Is anyone able to help with turning off the four beeps that periodically occur?I have already turned off all the speed limits warnings (because I use Waze for that) but the four beeps still occur occasionally. It appears that it may be something to do with over speeding when using cruise control but I can't be sure.
Littlelake writes...Is anyone able to help with turning off the four beeps that periodically occur?I think its lane control (on steering wheel). when you drift out of your lane it beeps.With active cruise control on, it turns the steering wheel.I have a left bend in my area where I often cut the corner and it beeps.
urie writes...I think its lane control (on steering wheel). when you drift out of your lane it beeps.Thanks but that���s not it as I have lane control turned off pretty much all the time and it still occurs.  It���s likely to be something very simple.
It occurs when using cruise control if the vehicle exceeds the speed you set.  It occurs when cresting a hill and the speed goes slightly above what you set. I haven't found a way to switch off the beeps but I did find that at the first beep if I touch the accelerator it tells the car that I'm OK with the speed. Alternatively you can press the cancel button and then the resume button. If you find a better solution please let all of us know.

So I got this as a rental hybrid 2x4, GX 2.5LI felt it really lacked lumbar support compared to my 2008 PassatAlso highway mileage is does not appear to be really good again compared to a diesel Passat- still driving so it will of course change.Lights for driving at night are excellent and the auto dim of the beam is very well implemented.The cruise is very much prius like. Is it possible at all to just turn off the media display.Also as its a rental I would really appreciate if some one could give instructions how to delete my phone and contacts synced in.Thanks
Sohaib writes...Also highway mileage is does not appear to be really good again compared to a diesel Passat-That���s probably correct. I also had a VW Golf diesel and it did better highway mileage than the RAV4 Hybrid. Hybrids really come into play with stop/ start (city) driving where they excel. Even so, my Hybrid still gets around 5.4 on the highway.
Anyone here waiting for a car that has damage to 'Chrome Strips' in NSW or ACT?It seems that there was a severe hail storm on 18th Feb at the Toyota Holding Yard @ Port Kembla and lot's of people who are waiting for their shiny new Rav 4's haven't been told the truth!
Tom1959 writes...It occurs when using cruise control if the vehicle exceeds the speed you set.  It occurs when cresting a hill and the speed goes slightly above what you set.So does it mean the RAV4 cruise control can not brake to a speed when just set on a long hill decline?
jnu123 writes...So does it mean the RAV4 cruise control can not brake to a speed when just set on a long hill decline?It will use both engine braking and increased regenerative braking if a downhill run causes the vehicle to over speed but, like all other vehicle I���ve ever driven, you can still find yourself periodically going over the set cruise speed.
We ordered a RAV4 AWD Cruiser back in late Nov and just got a call from the dealer that they have car identical to the one we ordered in the yard. It is not the car we ordered but apparently one on which the customer couldn���t get finance if the salesman is to be believed. Problem is that is has a Dec compliance plate. Can anyone tell us if there have been any changes since Dec and if that leaves us any room to negotiate?
jnu123 writes...So does it mean the RAV4 cruise control can not brake to a speed when just set on a long hill decline?As mentioned above, engine braking and regenerative braking (if hybrid). My Edge drops down a few gears to increase the engine braking. However, while set, if you adjust the cruise's speed down by a large increment, the vehicle will brake straight away to try and match the new set speed. I notice this on a particular decline that drops from 80 to 60, as soon as the RSA notices the 60 sign, I hold the ��� switch for a moment and it automagically sets itself to 60 and brakes accordingly.
Anyone had issues with spotify on AA playing but not making any sound? Was using AA maps over the weekend but had the radio playing. Now when i play through spotify theres no sound.

BCMS writes...Dec compliance plate. Can anyone tell us if there have been any changes since Dec and if that leaves us any room to negotiate?Car production year is the number you need, not the compliance plate. The newer year will have better resale and less depreciation. If you don't need a car urgently you will be better off waiting.Having said that, the supply chain might have collapsed already and due to that you will be waiting a long time so if you need a car sooner rather than later, I would get it, 5 of Toyota's factories in Japan have been put in sleeper mode due to lack of demand of cars.You also need to keep in mind, it might have been produced already but transportin it across might have some issues with the lockdown scenario.
Thanks Sohaib, I certainly wasn���t aware of the production problems in Japan, that could well swing it. Mind you although we have no urgent need  at my age it is better sooner than later. The car is sitting in the yard I believe so transport is not an issue.

Just put down a $500 deposit for a Cruiser Hybrid awd, Crystal Pearl at $46500 full price with the option to pull out if the money market crashes. Told 6 months delivery.

Gujju writes...Just confirming since it is good price.It does indeed sound like a very good price. Personally, though, I don't take much notice of what people say they've paid until I know whether they had a trade in.   eg. If a dealer makes the trade in value much lower than what it should be then they can (on paper) show a large discount on the new vehicle price. That price may well be accurate but it needs to be taken into context of the entire deal. Perhaps dad can elaborate.
Littlelake writes...Exact vehicle that I picked up (plus Towbar).

Try calling Toyota shops in your state and see if they have your car in stock and offer to buy it immediately. Much easier if you're not too fussy with the colour. I'd aim for $44k minimum.

People still waiting for delivery. Based on the current covid19 situation, anyone contemplating cancelling their order even if that means they will lose their deposit?
Just signed up on a Cruiser Hybrid  AWD as a result of a fleet order that fell through, unable to obtain finance we were told. As it is exactly the model and  colour we had ordered over four months ago, with no delivery date in sight,  we took it. With the current economic conditions the way they are there may well be more opportunities like that coming along.

Not returning calls, arguing about claims etc. On the other hand, my previous experience with the NRMA in NSW was excellent.

I've driven my friend's last gen Forester XT which was a bit of a pocket rocket for an SUV. I was seriously considering a second hand previous gen Forester before I was tempted by the RAV 4 hybrid and ended up jumping on the base model (as all the features I cared about are standard).Just disappointing to see a potentially great fuel saving Forester ruined by a high price, mixed with a weak 2L engine and such poor fuel efficiency (some reports of >10L/100km city driving is atrocious for a hybrid). Such a missed opportunity!
Toyota has been doing hybrids for ages compared to Subaru. Subaru's tech isn't as advanced give it time. Foresters have been dulled due to their demographic who drive them.
VBHB writes...But with Subaru you get the excellent eyesight saftey system and AWD.I'm confused. The RAV4 offer both of those features. As far as I know, there's no review which pit the two against each other.If you test drive the Forrester hybrid and RAV4 hybrid, make sure you go on a 100km/hr freeway and see if you can put pedal to the floor as you merge. Report back on your thoughts :)

That is usually a very easy fix at the dealer, adjusting the bonnet catch and rubber bump stops either side, which are usually on a screw thread. Takes only a couple of minutes for adjustment
Tried a couple of more dealers today. Got quoted $45,700 and $45,900 for 2WD Cruiser Hybrid. So far I have met/spoken to 5 dealers and they all are saying that they don���t make much money on Hybrids. I think $44k will be hard to achieve and I may settle for $45k.
Remember the exchange rate has tanked from ��74-77 to now ��64-66. Given the downturn and although the dealers buy it at a fixed price from TMCA and who buy it at a fixed price from TMC in A$.

Hi all.    I have the RAV4 Petrol GXL (2020) and I'm having some weird issues with the inbuilt Sat Nav.It seems to be avoiding any route that includes toll roads.  For example, I needed to take the car back to Springwood (QLD) last week for its 1 month service.  If I google map from my house to Springwood, it estimates at about 30 minutes, taking the Logan motorway (toll road).  However ��� when I plug the same details into the RAVs sat nav, the shortest possible route is 52 minutes and doesn't take the toll road at all.I thought that maybe the default setting was to avoid tolls, but I've searched the manual and played with the system and can't find anything  that shows this as a default and lets me change it.  I also looked at the '3 route' option on the Sat Nav ��� but every single one of the 3 routes avoids the toll road so its not like its even bringing it up as an option.   I don't think its an outdated map or service update that's required, because the Logan motorway is not a new road and has been around for years, plus my car is only a month old (2020 build).I know that I can just use google maps through my phone ��� but I want to be able to use the inbuilt sat nav .  Can anyone help with this ��� why would it be avoiding this toll road and what am I missing to be able to set 'fastest possible route' regardless of tolls, as the default.  Thanks for any replies or advice on this!
On my Cruiser AWD, my sat nav defaulted to Tollways which I changed to avoid.  I know you want to do the opposite of this.    Try this..........Go to map.  On the left there of the screen there should be a few icons.  The 4th from the top ��� not sure what the picture is supposed to be of ( it is the one above the speaker with a line through it).  It should show ROUTE OPTIONS , then select PREFERENCE and under SELECT WHICH ROUTE TO ALLOW, select $TOLL ROADS (its hard to see on mine but a blue vertical line on the left of the text confirms that the option is selected.  I unselected it and now successfully avoid toll roads. There may be an easier way, but I know that this worked for me. Push the button to select and you should see a blue line and have toll roads enabled.

I would never have even thought to look there ��� particularly because its not a default icon on the home map screen, it only appears when you have already selected an address to drive to.  Once I figured that out and got the the icon to appear ��� I was able to easily go in and change it, so now both motorways and tolls are switched on, and its now directing me to the quickest possible way to get anywhere, horray!Thanks again for your help on this one ��� I would never have figured it out otherwise!
Just wondering what driveaway prices people have been quoted for the Cruiser AWD Hybrid recently? I called some local QLD dealers (no haggling, just a query) and was quoted ~$49-50K
Instant Human writes...and was quoted ~$49-50KAccording to the Toyota website, setting Brisbane as the location.  The full driveaway price for a Cruiser AWD Hybrid is $48553.00   If they're wanting more, then buy it online.Edit: Plain White colour.
I was quoted on red one, so $500 on top of above which is basically RRP. Was just wondering if anybody has done better recently before I try to negotiate.

Also, if you're in the SE corner and you've only tried the metro dealers, make sure you try some of the regionals as well (eg. Beaudesert) as 9 times out of 10 they offer some sharp deals to customers outside of their PMA.
Leroy, picked up my car from Big Rock Toyota two days later. Agree with what you���re saying. I drive the same car and averaging 5.1l which is bloody amazing.

I managed to find a 2WD Cruiser Silver Sky as incoming stock at a dealer in Vic and signed the contract for $46990 with full tank of petrol, mats and a year���s rego. The car will be delivered before end of this month. They had a Crystal Pearl in stock too! but we took a bit longer to decide and someone else got it. I tried negotiating the price but it is in demand and they already had people querying about it.  I may have saved may be $1500-2000 had I kept negotiating with dealers but the wait was 4-6 months. We needed a car sooner So rather than spending money on something temporary we decided to put it towards the new car. Thanks everyone here who answered my queries, looking forward to the delivery ????

When you say you got the details the day they submitted the order to Japan are you saying you got the details the day you bought the car?AFAIK all Toyota dealerships enter in orders/submit orders to Japan once a month (not sure what date that happens to be). So you could have gotten lucky and bought the car same day they submit orders received.Also not surprised if my dealership know SFA although i did the deal with a mate there who i used to work with who is giving me a pretty good price on it and all my communication is through him so maybe he just isnt aware of this.

If they don't then it takes a fair bit of administration to backtrack and get them.
I never did get my login details, got the car instead as described earlier. Been playing around with the phone (iPhone 6) and having no end of trouble setting up Apple CarPlay.

Probably a 2019 model then. Cosmetically I believe the 2019 and 2020 are identical.
I did say built date late December, 2019 that is. I reckon the salesman picked out an older manual (for the current model) out of the pile of manuals at the dealer. By the way I inspected the previous model in hybrid version in Holland just under two years ago, price was about $75k in our dollars!

Ordered mid January, delivery confirmed end of May from toyota tracking. I dont think the rrp matters as I did get a pretty good price. I have a suspicion it is due to demand per dealer. If a dealer gets a lot of orders, it is going to take a while.
Jerk Face writes...Is the 2.0 litre petrol gutless?HI mate, i've got the petrol in the cruiser. Wouldn't say its gutless but no powerhouse either. For me it serves its purpose.Only had two trips out of town down the highway for 100 kms but seemed to handle it fine. Mind you the highway north and south of me is fairly flat and forgiving ( pacific between brisbane and sydney)was looking forward to seeing how it handles having 4 family and bags loaded up for a trip north for 5 hours at easter.Obvs not happening now, but im sure it would have been more than capable.With any highway travel we would be doing in it overtaking isn't an issue as most is dual carriageway where we would be heading.On a side note i drive mine on " normal " mode. There is sport mode which does something revs wise ( or something ) and does make it a little more punchy. I suppose in summarising It would depend on what sort of driving you would be doing. But I am happy, and this is coming from my normal drive of a V8 clubsport.
Took a Hybrid for a spin yesterday, was surprised how harsh the engine noise was compared to my 2.0Lt Tucson. Apart from that enjoyed the experience.

Jerk Face writes...Reviews and your testimony does sound promisingTestimony sounds like a strong word ! ;-) I'd go with opinion.But jokes aside, we don't do many kms a year , maybe 7500 if that, so it didn't warrant me going to the hybrid.Mind you I personally didn't like the drive of the hybrid, it wasn't as " refined " as I would assume it would be.  When the petrol motor kicked in you well and truly new about it. Mind you I had no experience with them in the past. Also the test I drove had a noticeable "whine " when slowing down. Which is something to do with the electric setup recapturing the energy or such. It may have just been that vehicle but was quite intrusive.  This was last year and I think I heard they have more sound deadining in them now ( but not positive).The petrol demo i drove last year ( september ) was also louder in cabin than i thought it would be, it was a combo of engine, road and wind noise. But my Jan delivered car is much quieter.As i alluded to, I dont know how it would pull up a big hill with a big load in it, as that's not to much of an issue for me with  the driving I do.

Toyota���s 10 yr warranty for the battery only applies if you do their annual battery check up. I don���t like to be tied to a stealership for servicing for so long.

Also it's pretty fun hypermilling it to run entirely on battery :)Also pretty sure the hybrid has more towing power?

No doubt more people in 5 years will be looking to hybrids ? But I suppose it���ll also depend on age and status of the batteries, which may come into the equation. Slow we will find out !On the topic of towing it���s not a worry for me as I won���t be towing at all. But have read the hybrid ( if I recall ?) ) has more torque which would help in these situations.The power difference to me at least didn���t jump out In test drives , but others have mentioned it.

Can someone, who has got a 2020 Cruiser Hybrid confirm if the black plastic around wheels and side skirts in Australian model have matte finish or glossy like the one in link below? I think the glossy plastic looks better but may scratch easily.https://youtu.be/l_5sVZopWCA
Matt finish. Glossy not available in Australia.
Has anyone purchased a dashmat? If so, where from?

Hi,Having an issue with a dealer and not sure what to do. I have just had my Rav 4 delivered and they have added a 1.1k dashcam that I never asked for. I had the discussion with the dealer and said I would make a call when the car arrived. I have the original contract and it is not on the contract but has magically appeared in the final payment request. The price is great and I don't want to lose the car but I also don't want to pay 1k for a crappy dashcam. They said that it is already installed and can not remove it and if I do not accept the car they will give it to the next person on the list and I will be at the back. Should I just suck it up and take the car with the Cam or do I have any other avenue?
Show them the contract you two both signed.Speak to their manager. Get everything in writing.Threaten them you'll escalate to fair trading ��� this is bait and switch 101.What I think happened is,Someone cancelled their order and they originally had a dashcam as part of their contract.You were given first dibs and have the option of buying it with the dashcam.You should NOT lose the place in the queue.Confirm if that is the case.

Was it tracked from factory to yard? If yes. Its not your fault the dealer messed up.

Brian McGee writes...Threaten them you'll escalate to fair trading ��� this is bait and switch 101.Totally agree. Pretty pathetic from the dealer. If you were ever given a VIN, check that out too. It's their issue, not yours.
So for full context I have had a pretty rough run with these guys (I know a few people had issues as well). They completely refused to provide tracking even when Toyota got involved. I suspect they were bumping me as I went through a broker but that is a suspicious rather then a fact.So with the dash cam, I remember the discussion I had with the after sales person. It was about a week after the sale on the phone. They tried selling the paint protection and the dash cam. I outright said no to the paint and said the cam they offered was not that great so would pass. Then they offered the Blackvue one discounted from 1700 to 1100. I said I would think about it and make a call closer to delivery. At that point that person added it to the contract (without telling me). Since then that person left the business and they are saying it was legitimately added, I asked them to provide paperwork or my approval and they said that because she added it it must have been approved. I think it might have been a mistake in their process, ie the person was planning to get back in contact but had left the business.I���ll reach out to Toyota to see what they say.
BeerMonkeyGreen writes...I���ll reach out to Toyota to see what they sayWhy bother with Toyota?  Its the dealer that needs to make a decision.They either give it to you FREE or you walk.  Do you trust them removing  the dashcam with damaging anything?You are in the right.

The Ming Moles are the worst. As part of our sale we told the salesperson that we don't want to talk to one at all. It was the most pleasant new car purchase yet.

-----------------------------The Dreaded Space Saver Spare-----------------------------Can anyone advise me what other Toyota models have 18" alloys that will fit a 2020 RAV?I want to ditch the space saver spare and replace it with a good second hand allo
You know you can just buy a duplicate full sized wheel? Costs about $600.
Thanks for your response. But I find that price a bit unpalatable particularly given that it is a generic accessory that isn't the same pattern as the vehicle and secondly, you can get a full size spare wheel and tyre option for about $300 on the GX model. The whole thing is a con. I don't want to pay a ridiculous price nor do I want to reward petty, scummy behaviour by Toyota.Making it so difficult/expensive to get a proper spare in a country with regional roads like ours is totally absurd.
accipiter writes...Can anyone advise me what other Toyota models have 18" alloys that will fit a 2020 RAV?18" wheels are 18x7 +35.AFAIK, the 2nd hand option are the 18" Lexus RX wheel range. Toyota have moved offset away from the typical +50 to +45 probably in a move to improve handling with the wider track.4th gen RAV4 17" steels are +40 (3rd gen is +45). Scrub radius will be diff as well as overall diameter. Not ideal for 4WD to have different significantly different diameters.

accipiter writes...that isn't the same pattern as the vehicleI���m not sure what you mean but it���s identical to the other wheels on the RAV4.  It���s also a genuine Toyota product, not sure what you mean by saying it���s generic. You ask your dealer to add it to your order and they���ll happily oblige.
accipiter writes...Making it so difficult/expensive to get a proper spare in a country with regional roads like ours is totally absurd.It's not a con at all!It's simply wasteful to put another full size wheel into every single car that is on the road.They are something that is used 0.01% of the time that you are driving and contributes to:1: Wasting boot space2: Decreasing fuel economy from added weight3: Hundreds of tonnes of waste each year in largely unused rims and tyres.
Thanks for that. I found a very comprehensive site for wheelology that gave me that info also. https://www.wheel-size.com/tire/225/60R18/It seems that apart from the 2019-2020 RAV and Lexus only the US Nissan Rogue uses that size and offset.That could limit the options at the wreckers somewhat.
accipiter writes...Thanks for that.I found a very comprehensive site for wheelology that gave me that info also.I���m not sure about availability of the correct size but another option might be to fit some run-flat tyres so you don���t need a spare at all. A downside, of course, is that you would have to throw the tyre away if is does run flat and you drive on it for a few kms. I also looked at buying an additional wheel for my Cruiser but didn���t eventually go ahead even though the dealer stated that they would be able to make it fit.
I find wheel size site not 100% accurate so don't trust it 100% and commit to wheels without looking at the back of the wheels itself to confirm.Also be careful using other makers wheels coz Toyota is a hub centric fit aside from how weird it'd look.
I was told by a spare parts bloke standing behind his all-seeing screen that it was a general replacement for that size wheel. As such, the design didn't match the fitted wheels. That wasn't a problem for me as it was going into lockdown under the floor. However, the price was a problem.Thanks.
The question needs to be asked why isn't a full size spare available on all grades as an option for drivers who need it, not just the GX.To force owners who want a full sized spare wheel to pay extortionate prices is definitely a con.Your location and lifestyle may not warrant a full sized spare. Mine does.1. The wasted boot space amounts to a two inch layer over the tyre2. The difference in mass is about 2.7 kg more ��� not a major impost on fuel economy3. I am suggesting an optional purchase. Space saver spares will also end up at the tip ��� without the benefit of having made any contribution to tyre rotation.Thanks
With the spare tyre thing, 2.7kg might not sound great to you but multiply that across the hundreds of thousand cars around the world and multiply the extra usage of oil needed to cart around that, it is a massive impact to the global oil consumption for just one model. This also flows into the cost saving going to a space saver vs full sized tyre.Give you an example. I had to a cost cutting improvement that dropped the cost of spraying under the parcel shelf on the local Camry/Aurion. Cost saving was 40c. When you multiply that across the 250k annual production (I'm sure the question was asked to the export team), it adds up for just one cost cut enough to pay for an additional person on the factory floor.Btw, the pricing structure of Toyota doesn't allow for a cost effective option over buying the same part as a spare part as it would be classed as another combination.. another SKU for one of the better term.Yes to the rest of the world, there's a lot of "Why doesn't company x do.... ." scenarios raised but the realities are, people are still buying even with a space saver, it's not big of an enough issue to warrant them doing something, and Toyota is bigger than the Titanic to turn. It sucks for people like you but you're just a small minority that actually give 2 hoots.I'd recommend buying the set of rims overseas (Jeese Streeter or Import Monster have been reliable for me), either keep the 3 as spares in case one of them gets kerbed/scratched.
Been looking at this.I am essentially after a car that is no more than 3 years old, no more than 20,000km's done per year max and has apple car play and is preferably an SUV (I live in the middle of country WA).My max budget is about 35,000 as I have that saved up.Definitely liking the look of the 2019 RAV4 and most certainly fits all the above.First time buying a car, except for the one I bought off my parents 10 years ago, but that doesn't count.What is a reasonable price I should be able to expect from this current market? ��� I used to work in sales before I finished my degree, and I understand there are margins they have to hit, but just uncertain on how much room they reasonably have to move on the price.I ask this because I only ever buy something when I know I am getting a good deal, I heavily dislike paying for something where I am not getting a good deal.Thanks!
Leonhart writes...Been looking at this.Brand new GX is $34990 with nav.
Good to know, I am most certainly not after a new car, don't want my money to depreciate too much.Seems like it's not the best deal then if a new one is almost the same price as that.
Thanks for your considered response, SmellyTofu. I agree that it is a question of scale. However, it isn't a huge ask to address the need for something so fundamental to a subset of buyers. On further investigation, I was told that a wheel to match the ones fitted would be $1700 ��� that's each. This is quite a nasty first world problem. I wouldn't be surprised if the full sized spare is only slipped into the GX so as not to limit its potential for fleet sales.
Actually more interested in this (https://www.carsales.com.au/cars/details/2019-toyota-rav4-gxl-auto-2wd/OAG-AD-18387160/?Cr=1)Not sure how much to reasonably try and haggle for though.
might get 5% discount, but your location may impact (as well as availability).
Leonhart writes...eems like it's not the best deal then if a new one is almost the same price as that.The one in the ad is a GXL. Not the GX.
accipiter writes...Your location and lifestyle may not warrant a full sized spare. Mine does.That���s the point. Most don���t warrant a  full size spare. That���s why the option is there to buy one. Even if it is more than you would like to pay or think is worth.  Out of interest how often do you get a flat ?
For leonhartBoth gxl petrols. One has 4K less kms for 2 k more in price and is silver.  Would you prefer a particular colour? Or buying on price ?
Leonhart writes...I ask this because I only ever buy something when I know I am getting a good dealOn this point are you saying you won���t buy a car unless you know you are getting a good deal ? What happens if the deal you think you should get never arises ? Not buy a car ?
Correct, although it���s only because I���m not in a rush to buy a car, it will just be nice to have one, I can get away with not having one for at least another 6-12 months.@wazza Colour doesn���t bother me, prefer white, gray or black, but otherwise if I���m getting a good deal it doesn���t bother me
Leonhart writes..., it will just be nice to have one,Well unfortunately sometimes when it���s nice to have something , we sometimes need to pay for it. Even if it���s more than we had hoped. On a side note as above make sure you compare apples to apples and are positive of the models being compared. A second hand GXL  with low kays would have already lost its depreciation. And may be a start. Never know. Call them. There may be wiggle room. Good luck on your search.
Well Wazza what you say is quite true. Except the bit about there being an option to buy one. $1700 for a single, quite unexceptional rim is no choice at all.  Three flats in 10 years in my own vehicle ��� two of the sharp, deformed metal object type and a tree root sidewall puncture. But that pales compared to the number I have had at work. I'll discount those as being extreme conditions and just settle for three under average circumstances. To pursue this thought experiment a little further: so how many crashes have I had in the last 30 years? None. Despite the infrequency of crashes, I appreciate the value of the seat belts, air bags, crumple zones, etc that have never seen action in my vehicles. It's about probabilities and contingencies. And so it is with the great Aussie full sized spare.
accipiter writes...Three flats in 10 years in my own vehicleWell no doubt I feel you would fall into the exception. Hence why vehicles have space savers. Dunno about the 1700 dollar part either. Have not looked into prices of full sized spares. I thought someone mentioned earlier 1200 for a set or something ? Anyway from what I can recall I think I had the option when I bought my new rav , but nowhere near that price ? I thought it was along the lines of 600 ish.  I mean , since when does one rim cost that much ? I priced a full set a while ago for my other car and it was under 2 k for 4 rims. Is that price for the one replacement the same as the original on the vehicle ? Either way is it a problem to put the space saver on and get the tyre replaced at your earliest convenience ? Or just not an option ?
accipiter writes...Except the bit about there being an option to buy one. $1700 for a single, quite unexceptional rim is no choice at all.Not sure where you're pulling these figures from or if you bothered reading my post, so I suggest rereading it.

Thanks SmellyTofu. All of your suggestions have been helpful and I appreciate your responses. You're right about the crazy money bit. (The seller also calls the tyres Yokohamas?) I'll follow up your suggestions and hopefully get a reasonably priced result.Brian McGee ��� I did read your post. As I previously mentioned, the cheaper ($600) but still quite expensive option does not have the same pattern as the fitted tyres and the $1700 (for each rim) offering is the same pattern as fitted to the vehicle.

I have absolutely no reason to provide dubious numbers ��� all I'm trying to do is get a full sized spare for my vehicle at a fair and reasonable price.Wazza ��� see above re pricing.

Anyone bought a cruiser hybrid AWD recently? What's the price range $48k ? and waiting time?
we didn't want the extended wait for a  Cruiser (as was told Sept/Oct), so ordered a GXL (hybrid AWD) as it's what we are replacing ��� wife's previous GXL AWD gym taxi.  Eight weeks from Feb order, to production, to delivery. Staff are only working a three day week.

I got my auto fold switch from Amayama. Part # 84872-30070I don���t know if it���ll work but I���ll plug it in and use techstream to see if it comes up. Otherwise I���ll install an aftermarket auto fold relay which is easy enough to do.

I test drove both today, loved both but I liked the Cruiser Hybrid more than the Edge but I can get an Edge now rather than wait 8 months for a Cruiser. The hybrid felt smoother.Will I regret it? Not really too fussed with fuel savings as most of my driving isn't going to make maximum use of the hybrid. The ventilated seats were nice, interior trim really good. Loved the panoramic sunroof option.Also has anyone got a good recent price on an Edge? Can see loads of prices for the Cruisers and GXL but not much for the Edge.
I���d still get the hybrid for the grunt and resale... but 8 months is a long time. Just wished they kept the Adventure name instead of using Edge
"The fifth-generation Toyota RAV4 has been selling like hotcakes since its Australian launch last May, so much so that its new hybrid variants have been subject to unprecedented delivery times, but they will significantly improved in the second half of this year.Toyota Australia has secured incremental supply of the RAV4 Hybrid mid-size SUV from its Japanese factory. In fact, 8000 additional units will arrive in local dealerships from July."https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/new-toyota-rav4-hybrid-2020-supply-to-increase-thousands-of-extra-fuel-efficient-suvs-due

It is worth calling multiple dealers around you and see if there is any cancellation or incoming stock. I was looking for a 2WD Cruiser Hybrid and had also accepted that it is going to be a 6-8 months wait but then luckily found an incoming 2020 build at a dealer near my location, signed the contract on 3rd April & gonna pick up the car on 30th.

Expect truck loads of cancellations. It won���t be a 6 month wait. More like 3 months.
Interesting.. kind of wanna go the Hybrid after all if chances are good that the wait will be much less. I can't extend my current lease anymore and the dealership BM just e-mailed this thread (at 7.30!)However, we do have an option if you need a car sooner that if Finance is submitted and approved a rental vehicle is available and usually costs about the same as your Finance repayments.Wonder what vehicle they'd give me? Supra? :)
MintyPringle writes...kind of wanna go the Hybrid after all if chances are good that the wait will be much less.Search around and you should find one. I strongly recommend the Cruiser Hybrid. I bought the AWD Cruiser Hybrid with tow bar, floor and boot mats and Toyota DASHCAM (also got the windows tinted) and loving it. It performs very well (even when towing a box trailer) and I get 6.3l/100k around town!
703 writes...Expect truck loads of cancellations. It won���t be a 6 month wait. More like 3 months.Dont hold your breath.  Did a ring around today and dealers saying hardly anyone is cancelling.  On the facebook group it was reported that one dealer said that out of 180 orders they have had 2 cancellations.We ordered in December and delivery expected end of July.
I got quoted $49k when I first looked at the Edge/Adventure. There���s plenty used on Carsales which should give you a trend of how resale will go in the short term.I was in the same situation. I do very little k���s coz I do have another car but logically I should get a non hybrid but the transfer case moo noise and minor transmission gremlins put me off. Plus it was another $3k vs the hybrid and didn���t come in white so it just didn���t make sense for me as I know I���ll be spitting chips driving it.
DockTony writes...https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/new-toyota-rav4-hybrid-2020-supply-to-increase-thousands-of-extra-fuel-efficient-suvs-dueYeah this pretty much aligns with what I posted on here earlier this week.So 8k additional units to chew through the 12k hybrid backorders in Australia should definitely make the wait times better.

They're presumably running the lines at capacity (which may be determined by a third party, e.g. battery supplies) and then have to allocate production to numerous different countries, and profit is no doubt a key determinant of who gets what. Australia may or may not be one of their more profitable markets. A key thing is exchange rates ��� now A$50K translates to about Y3.4m; a year ago it would have been Y3.9m. Another factor is that keeping supply short removes the need to discount or advertise, further increasing profits.
Fx impacts are all hedged like any smart business but it will only last for so long.

703 writes...Expect truck loads of cancellations. It won���t be a 6 month wait. More like 3 months.No doubt, there will be some cancels happening.It will not make a dent on the 6-mths wait though. Those cancels are getting snapped up quick smart by someone else in the wait.What I think dealers are doing though, is offering the cancels to those interested but have not put in an order. And I bet those buyers are willing to pay full price just to leapfrog the big wait.As frustrating as the current short supply situation for the dealers, they are making the best of it and extracting top dollar for every one of the hybrids they get.
Marcus writes...What I think dealers are doing though, is offering the cancels to those interested but have not put in an orderI think a lot of the issue is also driven by dealers putting in dummy orders so they can then sell at top dollar once they come through.

Cruiser AWD Hybrid BrakingHas anyone noticed with the AWD Cruiser Hybrid that when coming to a stop at the lights or intersection, there seems to be a slight whiplash effect? The front brakes seem to grab harder and the front dips, tilting you forward and then as the car stops the front rises again whipping you backwards into the seat.This is only slight though but still concerning ��� seems either the front shocks need tuning or the front brakes are grabbing too hard.I know some of you may say this is a feature of hybrid vehicles and I know they tend to have a woody feel and I���ve driven other hybrids before, but have not felt this slight whiplashing effect in other cars, except the 2019/2020 RAV Cruiser AWD hybrid.
Wrrr writes...The front brakes seem to grab harder and the front dips, tilting you forward and then as the car stops the front rises again whipping you backwards into the seat.Modulate your pedal as you near each stop (i.e. gradually ease the pressure off slightly). This is good practice not just for hybrids, but any vehicle.
PinzVidz I do that already but other cars don���t seem to require this. I was wondering if it���s a RAV4 quirk or something wrong with my particular car
Wrrr writes...Cruiser AWD Hybrid BrakingHas anyone noticed with the AWD Cruiser Hybrid that when coming to a stop at the lights or intersection, there seems to be a slight whiplash effect?Not at all. I have the AWD Cruiser and haven���t noticed that.
Hmm maybe I should take my car in and have them check the shocks and brakes
Trapezoidal strip in top centre of camera screen: anyone know what this is and what it���s for? Annoying. Definitely not the shaded area behind the rear view mirror because that���s  not where the camera is.
I know that one of the reasons why people went for the AWD hybrid vs the FWD hybrid was because of the towing capacity of 1500kg vs 480kg. I had a hard time believing that with the extra electric motor, the car was able to tow three times more and the 2.5L hybrid tows less than the 2.0L petrol.So.... I did a bit of searching online, went to the toyota UK website and looked up their specifications sheet for their 2.5L FWD hybrid. And... lo and behold... their specifications is mostly the same except for the braked towing of 800kg. The UK rav4 is made in Japan as well.For reference:https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/rav4/features-and-specs/grade=a22e8ff1-47af-4cef-bffd-5a56d3f1d14a%7Cbodytype=30b0ef55-504f-4ce5-8f54-6856b2e8aa20I find 800kg logically more believable and wonder if Toyota Australia deliberately undervalued the towing capacity in Australia just to distinguish the AWD more. I am more than aware that 1500kg is still significantly more than 800kg but 800kg is definitely more usable than the 480kg quoted.What do you think?
Cooling capacity? Not too much difference down south, but towing a trailer from Port Hedland to Newman in the summer is really going to stress things and I guess they have to take worst case Australia.

Wrrr writes...PinzVidz I do that already but other cars don���t seem to require this. I was wondering if it���s a RAV4 quirk or something wrong with my particular carIt's a hybrid quirk where the vehicle speed gets low enough that the braking changes from regenerative to friction. There is a distinct change in braking force with constant pedal application. Once you drive it more, you will know exactly how to modulate the pedal to minimise the whiplash effect as you say.
Hi all.I got my cruiser hybrid yesterday and I'm hoping someone could help me. When I hold or press the power back door button on my remote/key all it does is blink red and the PBD doesn't open. The remote locks and unlocks all doors fine. I've checked the vehicle settings and made sure the PBD system is on. The button in the car and the button on the PBD both work. I have no clue what I'm missing here.Thanks in advance!

Yep I've been holding it and the remote/key just blinks red. Surely it can't be a battery issue since I literally got it yesterday right?
Well after 6 months wait finally picked up my hybrid cruiser 2WD last week. It was worth the wait! After reading some comments on here I do agree the rear camera quality is a bit average but does the job. Wonder if there is any way to increase the quality? An aftermarket upgrade maybe?

Otherwise, you'll need Techstream to adjust somePBD settings which aren't available on either of those screens. Find someone close by with Techstream on their lappie and a cable, or go to the dealer.I've customised mine to open/close with no beeping, plus reduced volume for the initial tone, along with remote open when locked (hold button for 2 seconds).7namdaci1 writes...Make sure the car is unlocked, the remote PBD won't work if the car is locked.Settings can be adjusted in Techstream to allow you to remotely open the PBD while the vehicle is locked.
Wondering if anyone has tried turning off the RSA (Road Sign Assist) function on their Cruiser. I got tired of it seeing 40 km signs outside schools and telling that is the current speed regardless of the time of day. I can turn it off but it turns itself back on.
Boincing writes...I got tired of it seeing 40 km signs outside schools and telling that is the current speed regardless of the time of day.I also find that a bit of a shortcoming in the sign recognition but I���ve decided to just live with it and ignore the incorrect speed limit for the time being.

Admittedly, not much help in case of a garage door.  2. Also it was discussed earlier in this thread that attaching the swimming noodle(s) along the middle of the garage door/ceiling may eliminate or at least reduce the potential damage to the pbd, as it is designed to stop opening if it finds itself pushing against the hard stop ��� you can literally stop it with your hand part way through the opening process.
digital_silence writes...1. You can change the setting of how widely the pbd opens,That was the first thing I did when I got the car home but the height is not the issue. The door extends well out the back of the car while it���s opening and that���s when it would hit the closed garage door.Also it was discussed earlier in this thread that attaching the swimming noodle(s) along the middle of the garage door/ceilingThat can���t be done either on mine because of the way the roller door folds up when it���s open.As per my note, the fact that I need to unlock the doors before I can raise the PBD is a bonus for me because it prohibits an accident from bumping of the OBD button on the remote. It���s actually the way I would prefer it so, fortunately, the default setting works fine for me.

Although it might indicate that the mileage is a lot better.Last news story I saw from the US said that Toyota are not really communicating with owners that have raised this concern while the are "investigating" this. I don't believe Australian delivered cars are impacted though.
Aussie RAV4s are built in Japan which definitely don���t have the problem. Mine is fine.
Pretty keen on the GX 2WD but I'm not sure if I should get the hybrid or petrol. The difference seems to be $5k upfront plus what the extra maintenance costs are. I only drive sub 10k KMs a year but I drive inner city so hybrid will put in a lot of work to my understanding? Planning to drive the car minimum 10 years potentially into the ground, my current car is 20+ years old as a reference. This could mean that with the hybrid I'd have an expensive battery replacement down the line? The hybrid sounds like it has better performance/is quieter but considering what I currently drive anything is an upgrade.Any feedback appreciated.
Ordinarily I would suggest buy the hybrid when buying a new Toyota. 163kw is almost V6 levels of performance, plus the better fuel economy and resale. Maintenance may be better with the hybrid with much less brake use.In your case though it sounds like the 2.0 would be more than fine, and it���s probably the best NA 2.0 engine in the segment. It is also very good on fuel. I would drive it and see if you are happy with the performance, some 2.0 litre competitors are absolute shockers in this SUV segment.Just bare in mind you do get a couple more features on the GX hybrid like dual zone climate and smart start (but no smart entry which kinda defeats the purpose). Those two things wouldn���t really be enough to sway me though.Sounds like the 2.0 could be a good match.
Good morning all. Looking at buying a new/demo Rav. Local dealer (NSW) has a 2019 GXL Hybrid 2wd they are currently using as a demo with around 2000km on it. Car has a few extras on it ��� nudge bar, side steps, cargo barrier etc. I called the dealership about availability and they said leaving a deposit would guarantee the car when it became available and they emailed back a quote of just under 44k. I'm just wondering for those with a bit more knowledge what price would be reasonable/should I aim for with negotiating, if there is any negotiations to be had.Thanks.
Think GX and Cruiser are the best buys in the range. GXL is a little too close to GX in spec but too close to Cruiser in price. If you get a good deal on GXL then it changes everything and can be great, but would not entertain 44k for a demo 2wd GXL hybrid. I���d keep looking around
Turk3y writes...I called the dealership about availability and they said leaving a deposit would guarantee the car when it became available and they emailed back a quote of just under 44k.From the Toyota website, you can order a brand new one online ��� base 2WD GXL Hybrid for $42k driveaway in Queensland ��� and you get to pick the colour.  You might just have to wait a bit.The 'Extras' would all appear to be added to your price at RRP.   Then it's a demo and overall doesn't seem like a deal.I was just under the $44k for GXL AWD Hybrid, brand new.   Definitely keep looking.  The dealer seems to be relying on the overall shortage of supply which won't last forever.   Some were getting their 2WD Cruiser Hybrids at this price, but perhaps not anymore.At the end of the day, pay what you're happy to pay.  I'm happy with my price and after 21,000k's still absolutely love the car.
Am I the only one who feels the car pull left during hard acceleration?Tourque steer? AWD hybrid.I've had wheel alignment checked out.
Turk3y writes...I'm just wondering for those with a bit more knowledge what price would be reasonable/should I aim for with negotiating, if there is any negotiations to be had.There generally is a bit of negotiation but Toyota is in a interesting spot with little stock of the Hybrids in the country that hasn't yet been sold. This means that you won't have as much negotiation power. Is it in the colour you are looking for?

LOL writes...I've had wheel alignment checked out.I normally have that done after about 3,000km in  new vehicle. This has become a habit for me since years ago the vehicles invariably had poor alignment when they were new. I'm sure that's not so much the case these days with more accurate manufacturing processes but I might still do it anyway (currently 2,600km on mine).What was the verdict (from the tyre people) on the existing alignment of your vehicle?
Turk3y writes...called the dealership about availability and they said leaving a deposit would guarantee the car when it became available and they emailed back a quote of just under 44kAs others have mentioned , not that enticing When we bought , back in September mind you , we were offered the 2WD hybrid cruiser for under this price. Mind you things have changed since then. Price has gone up a little , and obviously availability. The demo you mentioned does have the extras , but how much they add to the sale price of the vehicle I���m unsure.
Can anyone pls tell me the location of the interior fuse box for Australian (RHD) RAV4 2019 model? I mean, the one in the salon, not under the hood. Youtube videos all refer to LHD model. Thanks.
digital_silence writes...Can anyone pls tell me the location of the interior fuse boxI haven���t checked it myself but I believe it���s at the base of the glovebox.
I just remembered that the installer I used for my dashcam explained where the fuse box was so he could install the power magic pro (for parking usage).There's a clip in plastic panel under the glove box. I just removed it, and lo and behold, there's the fuse box that they've tapped into.
Just noticed when I put my hybrid cruiser in reverse, the reverse camera actually captures the bottom part of the rego plate, it shows up on the bottom 10mm of the display screen... is this normal? The camera seems to be fixed and can't be adjusted.

Might be looking to by a Rav4, is it a good time to buy atm?Have a 15+ year old prado that needs to see retirement.There are so many damn variants, for this Rav4, so confusing.
Some Cruiser questions for those that know.Does it have automatic headlights/high/low beam?Are they rain sensing wipers?When using cruise control, does it modulate the speed and slow down on it's own when going down hills?When using adaptive cruise control can you control the distance to the car in front?
Bedford writes...Can anyone with a Cruiser answer a few queries for me?I'll give it a go. But only from my experience, can't be bothered searching through the Manual, you can do that yourself. Cruiser 2WD Hybrid.Does it have automatic headlights/high/low beam?Auto ON/OFF, depending on ambient light conditions, don't think they can switch automatically between high and low beam.Are they rain sensing wipers?  Adjusts the speed depending on rain heaviness. Don't think they can kick in automatically when the rain starts.When using cruise control, does it modulate the speed and slow down on it's own when going down hills?Yes, it brakes for you. Also brakes when you adjust the speed setpoint to the automatically recognised speed sign of the lower speed.When using adaptive cruise control can you control the distance to the car in front?Yes, but you can't set the distance in meters as such. There are just three distance settings (far, medium, close) and you can switch between them. I go via freeway every day and try to keep it to 'close', otherwise there always be someone cutting in from the adjacent lane, and that makes RAV4 to brake abruptly (see the previous paragraph) ��� not a pleasant feeling.Note that you can still elect to use the cruise control mode where it just maintains the set speed, regardless of the distance to the front car, just like in the early generations of cruise controls.
Had a good look.Might go for the Cruiser 2WD 2.0L in Atomic Rush. Wonder what the wait times are. I don't want to spend too much. What deals are people buying them for lately?I like all the little extra features with the Cruiser Trim, without the need to spend extra on higher engine variants

digital_silence writes...don't think they can switch automatically between high and low beamYes they can.From the specs.https://www.toyota.com.au/-/media/toyota/main-site/vehicle-hubs/rav4/files/rav4-spec-data-nov2019.pdfToyota Safety Sense12 ��� Including Lane Departure Alert, Lane Trace Assist (auto CVT only), Pre-Collision Safety system with pedestrian and daytime cyclist detection, Road Sign Assist, Automatic High Beam and Active Cruise Control (All-speed on auto and auto CVT.

KevinBacony writes...Might go for the Cruiser 2WD 2.0LNot trying to throw a spanner in the works but IMO the Rav is fantastic, but for me the star of the show is the Hybrid setup in my GXL.Not only is the fuel economy awesome and easily achievable consistently tank after tank.It also has way more power than I was expecting, zero lag compared to turbo cars and is very quiet when driven lightly in EV or low revs.I���m not sure if you have driven one to compare, but if you haven���t just drive one before signing up.
LOL writes...Can you please explain what you mean here?We discussed earlier in this thread that there is a mode of a cruise ctrl where the long press on the speed setpoint adjustment buttons instantly snaps the setpoint to the last recognised speed limit sign. If that speed limit is significantly lower than the current setpoint, the car brakes pretty agressively, rather than just cruising down to the new speed setpoint. I do that every day, when I go 100 on the freeway and hit the "roadworks" section with the limit of 80. My cruiser recognizes 80 and signals that to me, I long press the down button and it brakes quite heavily. Sometimes, if someone is talegating me,  I even don't do that, to avoid getting hit, but rather go down gradually by the series of twenty short presses.
What does "Electro-chromatic rear-view mirror" mean?
dad writes...What does "Electro-chromatic rear-view mirror" mean?When bright light shines on the rear view mirror it auto dims (greenish tint) so that same light does not shine into your eyes causing distracted driving.Example transitioning from dark into a sunny day- Garage, under cover parking, the car driving behind with full beam on.
digital_silence writes...We discussed earlier in this threadThank you very much for the explanation, I���ll need to try it next time I���m out.
I must have looked at that spec sheet 30+ times previously and I never noticed that.Thanks
digital_silence writes...someone is talegating me,  I even don't do that, to avoid getting hit, but rather go down gradually by the series of twenty short presses.Why not just brake to 80 and set cruise ?Either way I think you can change your cruise increments when you press the button. Like it will drop / increase 5 kms ( instead of 1 km) with each press  of the + ��� buttons ?
Found this link on a Rav4 facebook page enabling the mirrors to auto fold on locking/unlocking doors.https://tracelectronics.com.au/shop/auto-folding-mirror-module-suits-toyota-rav4-2019-onward/?fbclid=IwAR2viAUFYJcbslaLk9vlg_RJRrgKDg4LTj-HFHuGU2Z8pgldUlo8lqDQqQc
@ dadThanks for the link.
Wazza77 writes...Why not just brake to 80 and set cruise ?My feet are elsewhere... :-)Seriously, you have to start paying attention to the speedo to make sure you braked to below 80. Then lock the setpoint and fine adjust it to 80 if you didn't get it right.All that vs one long buttonpress. If only Toyota got that braking right, making it not too sharp... Oh well.
And what if you get booked because Toyota didn���t slow you down fast enough?
Wrrr writes...And what if you get booked because Toyota didn���t slow you down fast enough?I will then have to pay the fine, I guess.But it does. My subjective feeling is that it brakes hard so that it is definitely uncomfortable, on the boarder to being harmful. But I am prepared to trust Toyota designers' calculations of the safe g-forces limits during braking.  Wet finger in the air, if it brakes from 100 to 80 over say two seconds, that's about G/3 in horizontal direction. That's Okay.As I said, I am more concerned about getting hit from the back, no mater who brakes sharp, Toyota or my own foot...
Auto fold Mirrors????I just fold the mirrors if needed in a car park.Turn off system. then push fold in mirrors then exit car.on arrival i get into car start up mirrors fold out automatically then drive off.this way they only fold in and out as required and not every time i shut down.I intend keeping the car for many years and don't want the mirror motors to wear out.
What exactly is your question, rroland?Australian version of RAV4 2019/20 does not have an option of the autofold mirrors. It p!$$es off many owners, me included. Above on this page, there is a link to the aftermarket DIY kit that is claimed to provide the autofolding functionality. Hope anyone will try it soon and report here.
Need to use our new RAV4 AWD Hybrid Cruiser in the near future to tow a trailer. Not looking forward to it as the visibility out of the back window isn���t the best and I am an old fashioned looking over the shoulder type when reversing. But my question is to those with some experience towing with the RAV4, in regard to the safety systems is there anything I need to turn off like eg BSM? The manual isn���t much help.
BCMS writes...But my question is to those with some experience towing with the RAV4, in regard to the safety systems is there anything I need to turn off like eg BSM? The manual isn���t much help.On my old VW Golf, connecting a trailer used to automatically turn on some of the safety setting (like rear sensors) and you had to manually turn them on again once the trailer was removed. On the RAV4, I don���t turn off anything and the rear sensors appear to behave fine. ie. they don���t constantly warn of something behind  you, even when reversing with the trailer.I own a heavy duty 6x4��� box trailer (checker plate floor, extra leaf springs) and the AWD Cruiser tows it with ease.
BCMS writes...Need to use our new RAV4 AWD Hybrid Cruiser in the near future to tow a trailerWhats the tow weight limit for the Hybrid Cruiser?
digital_silenceNot a Question Just explaining how I use them using the existing system.They (Toyota) design things to suit the market in each market (Country) and you need to adapt to how it best suits your requirement.
2fast4uI tow several thingsYou have to have AWD as it uses the rear engine a lot. Prevents sway on cornering and in astern( i sometimes tow boats so it assists on ramp recovery)Visibility via the Cam is not setup for towing and when backing up visibility is crap looking back.I open the Back door and it is good.1500 Kg in AUS But this is different in UK. Fuel economy drops  and uses the petrol motor a lot moreMine is a GXL AWD Hybrid
Thanks for all the advice, never thought about opening the rear door, brilliant. Wasn���t looking forward to doing it on the camera. In my case towing a trailer of garden or other refuse to the local tip is about all we do with it.
don't know why the back window went smaller.
rroland writes...1500 Kg in AUSCheers rroland.
rroland writes...Not a Question Just explaining how I use them using the existing system.I must admit your statements sound bit cryptic to me.You said:rroland writes...Mine is a GXL AWD Hybrid(I assume it is RAV4 2019). You also said earlier:rroland writes...Turn off system. then push fold in mirrors then exit car. Sorry that's not possible, unless your RAV4 is not an Australian model. When the engine (Vacc) is off, you can not fold the mirrors down in Oz model.
DSWhen you shut down the switch is returned to the open positionMirrors stay in place (SHUT)Then on return you start up the mirrors then go to the open position with no action from the driver and presto like magic all is OK.
Unfolding the mirrors is not an issue.The issue is with folding them down AFTER the engine is turned off. You claimed you were able to do that. That's what made me think that you are not living in Australia. Are you?Edit: I see what you are saying. You fold them down when the engine is still on, then switch off the engine and flick the switch to unfold, to make them auto-unfold when you start the car next time. Unfortunately, this does not address the issue when you need to switch off the motor then open the door while still looking into the mirror, and then fold it down.
Each to his own
digital_silence writes...Unfortunately, this does not address the issue when you need to switch off the motor then open the door while still looking into the mirror, and then fold it down.When is this ever a common scenario?I much prefer auto-fold mirrors, especially for train car parks where pinheads charge in between cars and bust mirrors all the time.

Before I Open the door and leave the car, I simply turn around to check for any vehicles or cyclists. I normally crack the door open very slightly first as a warning to cars or cyclists, then turn around to check and if all clear I open the door
Menco writes...Shouldnt people have know this before they bought one? Why would they be getting upset for not doing their homeworkThis is a standard delivery option in other countries, and I am yet to hear one reason why they took it off in Au version. COGs saving does not stand an argument, as there is virtually no saving, especially considering the cost of maintaining different parts (door switch assy) and BOM options now. So, my upset has nothing to do with getting caught by surprise. It is mainly to do with having been left without an option to pay extra and get this feature back as, once again, it is a STANDARD feature, with no commonsensible reason given. Nevertheless, my upset in this case was not big enough to repell me from buying this car. And last, but not least: I reserve my right to get upset or even p!$$ed off with anything I find appropriate to do so with.
Wrrr writes...Before I Open the door and leave the car, I simply turn around to check for any vehicles or cyclists. I normally crack the door open very slightly first as a warning to cars or cyclists, then turn around to check and if all clear I open the doorThat all makes a perfect sense to do, but it would be of an order of magnitude easier if you could do all this while also looking in the rear view side mirror at the same time. Which you can not now, as the mirror is folded down by the time you start opening the door.
stumpy85 writes...When is this ever a common scenario?I much prefer auto-fold mirrors, especially for train car parks where pinheads charge in between cars and bust mirrors all the time.My scenario is not mutually exclusive to your one. The auto-folding option comes also with the ability to manually fold/unfold the mirrors even when the car is switched off. In our RAV4 models, both options are absent, unfortunately, even though it is a standard delivery option in RHD model, sold say in UK.
If we were to install this automatic mirror closer in our ���still under warranty��� RAV4, could this void the warranty, given that this was not an original part of the vehicle?
Only if the part you fitted could be shown to have caused or contributed to the warranty claim you are making.   Certainly if after fitting it there was a problem with the mirrors then you  may have difficulty making a warranty claim.
BigMick63 writes...RAV4, could this void the warranty, given that this was not an original part of the vehicle?Tom1959 writes...Only if the part you fitted could be shown to have caused or contributed to the warranty claimHmm, you'd have to be careful here.  If something does go wrong, most retailers will quickly jump on the 'you broke it, you fix it train' regardless of where the issue might be.IE: If you're taking the interior door skin off, then basically everything behind it would be void of warranty.  So if your window motor misbehaves in the future and you've been 'in there' then you'd likely have a fight on your hands.  Each to their own though...

HI,I have had my 2020 Rav4 GXL hybrid AWD for 3 weeks and since new it has had a wind noise coming through the right hand side air vent. It sounds like the noise you get when you blow over the top of a glass bottle. Its purely related to the speed of the car, from 75kph till 95kph. Closing the vents, air recirc, foot or windscreen vents does nothing to change the sound. Engine revs and even in neutral down a hill doesn't change the sound. Just had the 1000km service and Toyota dealer has absolutely no idea what it is.Just hoping someone else might have experienced this and has an answer. the noise is driving me crazy.
Haven't got it but probably haven't been over 80 yet. We were in the same delivery (and GXLH). You could try a larger dealer, see the service manager.
Check the door to seal fit- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNVwTtWcczEAlthough it's possible the vent ducting hasn't been connected properly and they'd have to dismantle the dash to check and they won't be too keen on that as chasing wind whistle can be a lot of trial and error. In the meantime it shouldn't bother you until after August- https://www.msn.com/en-au/motoring/news/toyota-rav4-owners-asked-to-drive-cautiously/ar-BB14rjZ2Welcome to appliance cars and pioneering new models ;)
Definitely not door seal. Myself and dealer have taped up all panel and door lines outside and no difference, had to climb in from passenger side. Even opened door at 80kph and sound still there.

I���ve heard a similar noise once or twice at the same speeds that you noted and I believe it might be wind passing the mirror if there���s a slight cross breeze. I haven���t heard it for some time now. On my vehicle it is a rare occurrence.
Have you tried taping around the mirror lines. That is a frequent source of odd wind noise
Did that. Fold mirror in whilst driving as well. The noise is coming from the right hand vent, but is not related to fann or vent settings. It's like the noise is being transmitted along the vent tube.
The noise is there anytime I'm driving around the 80kph mark. It doesn't go away and windy or still air outside makes no difference. Dealer has put in a report to head office, still waiting to hear back.
capetarn writes...It's like the noise is being transmitted along the vent tube.Is it the same at over 80���s with a window down half way?

Toyota RAV4 Foot-Activated Power Liftgate is available in USA.  Anyone knows how to add a aftermarket kick sensor and then enable it in firmware? I do not understand why such important feature is missing in AU market.
Just  got our GXL AWD and the lack of hooks in the boot is really bothersome.  Looking to install some tie hooks for shopping bags, etc but can't seem to find any videos on YouTube on where it is safe to drill the mounting screws in the boot plastic trim (I don't want to accidentally hit a wire or something).  Anyone done anything like this before?On the flip side, super impressed with the fuel economy (averaging 5L/100kms always driving in Sport mode) even though only done 550 kms so far.  Best so far was 3.8 on the way home from work once.  Can't imagine it could possibly improve further when the engine is "broken in".
Things will always improve once the engine has had time to loosen up.Give it 10,000 km and then see what happens.
Hi all,Looking at the GXL FWD Hybrid, what sort of prices are people paying? and what is the waiting period.Car sales have fallen significantly, so hopefully more competitive pricing available? especially coming up to eofy.

If I have the cruise control set on 100 km per hour and driving on a flat stretch on the freeway. I then come across a medium climb which results in the revs going to 4000 rpm to keep the speed at 100. Should I cancel the cruise control at this point or let it run at 4000 rpm till the climb flattens out? I am thinking this thinking this high rpm is not good for the motor.
BennoB writes...Should I cancel the cruise control at this point or let it run at 4000 rpm till the climb flattens out?The car knows what it���s doing and, in any case, 4,000rpm is fine. How did you know it���s doing 4,000 rpm?

I have a Hybrid and I use a OBD2 Bluetooth Dongle and it is very interesting how the motor performs on the hybrid system. I can monitor the Battery 280 volt that is and the RPM's when required.now it is winter and a lot colder I notice that the engine seems to operate more having a higher storage percentage and heats the battery's. It definitely is a smart car

Apparently auto-folding mirrors is coming to the RAV in the update later this year (August apparently though new updates typically come out in November for Toyota).I don't think there's going to be an update for existing cars though but good work to all those who emailed in and complained ��� you guys got it added for future purchasers!
Our Rav 4 Cruiser 2WD is apparently scheduled for production in June. We have a batch number that it is meant to be part of but no login details for the portal yet (which hopefully comes once production starts).Does anyone have a current feel on how long we are likely to be waiting once it enters production?Anyway to track a batch number?
Does anyone have issues where using a USB key for music, when you start the car the audio system is turned off?Every time i start the car, no audio. Screen says "Audio off". You can start it by going into Audio and selecting the USB key source and it works fine, or the buttons on the steering wheel, until you turn the car off again.It appears to only be when using USB. If i set the car to FM radio, it starts on car start without issue.I cant see any settings anywhere to control this. Its damn annoying.

I don't think it's possible to retrofit it just yet as the option does appear in the dealers techstream software but enabling it does nothing. People also tried fitting in the folding mirror switch from other models but that still doesn't make it work so there is probably a relay which has to be added.There's an aftermarket kit linked in the previous page though which works. I'll probably be going down that route myself.

Most likely yes)In the current (non-auto) Au implementation, the folding motors for both mirrors are controlled just by the switch (no ECU signals are involved), and they are fed from Vacc power rail.In the autofolding config, those motors are controlled via 2x relays (from Vbat), and can use either mirror fold switch signals (in manual fold/unfold) or ECU signals (car lock/unlock)Hope this helps.

HI,Not sure if the best place to ask but want to see if I have been able to negotiate the best deal on a new rav4:Toyota RAV4 GXL 2WD Hybrid in Atomic RedI have a written price of $40,600 (website says $42,535.00) and they told me that was open to further negotiation, I sad 40k flat and then told to make a deposit (which I did not want to do as have to discuss with my wife first). This included floor mats.Given it's the end of the month and this salesperson has already called me back twice I am feeling I could get it below 40k (I am in QLD so stamp duty might be different, but is included in this price, I am talking to a dealer on the south side of Brisbane). Any thoughts? Planning to buy on Saturday 30th May as the end of the month.Also, I had two brokers try to get prices for me, one was 41k and the other 40,559. So I think I am going to do better. I am not trading a car and will not be using finance. I know the wait is around 6 months but have read this might be better after July production run. See Facebook group "Australians waiting for 2020 RAV4s" https://www.facebook.com/groups/2921809104543087/
When do you actually start payments of a car loan/finance? On the date of purchase or when the car actually arrives?With a 6 month delay, is it just a deposit or do you have to begin paying off the car loan?
actionspeed writes...I know the wait is around 6 monthsA huge amount of orders are being filled in June and July.  Some of the dealers in the facebook group are saying they will have no backlog come end of July so you are probably looking more at 3 months wait now.
VeinyPickle writes...With a 6 month delay, is it just a deposit or do you have to begin paying off the car loan?Just the deposit until you get the car, unless you have organised a personal loan through the bank.
VeinyPickle writes...When do you actually start payments of a car loan/finance? On the date of purchase or when the car actually arrives?Depends on who you are going through. Most banks don't require you start payments until disbursement of the money, but they also generally only allow 90 days between approval and disbursement. Some offer a 'capacity to pay' check to make sure that you can actually service the loan, then you can submit the application closer to the delivery date.
I haven't seen much price discussion lately. Been ringing around the last 2 weeks for AWD Cruiser + Floor/Cargo Mats, Tint and Weathershields. The best price I've gotten so far is $46,560, how does that compare with what others are getting?

I've done a fair bit of searching online and cannot find the measurements, but does anyone know how wide the rear seat is?I'm trying to work out if the existing dog car seat cover will fit or if we'll need to buy a new one.The closest I've been able to find is 'Shoulder width', which I assume is from window to window in the rear section.

Checked out theRav4 hybrid today with my parents today. Toyota certainly has a smash hit. Test vehicle was crawling with customers. Fantastic cars.Quoted 4-5 month wait for AWD Cruiser. So may as well get the colour they want. Colour variety is pretty disappointing.Actually think the black would look great with the black wheels. But living on a dirt road may get the bright blue or dark red.Did anyone get the nutmeg interior , does it stain easily?
Help us decide ��� Toyota Rav4 Cruiser Hybrid vs Mazda CX5 Akira Turbo  :Both about the same price give or take.Keeping either for 5/7 years.RAV4 Cons ��� No passenger powered seat, No Reverse AEB, No Auto Fold Mirrors, Wait of 4-6+ months.CX5 Cons ��� More servicing cost, more fuel use, lower resale?, Smaller boot, CX50 replacement model in 2022 so obsolete (leaked).CX5 seems to win on luxury feel insideAnyone else think of anything that may sway us one way of the other ?

I guess its a heart vs head thing, plus the wait ��� never waited for cars before, never ordered one before, always ask whats around and they have done dealer swaps to get what we want in the past 4 cars.

Has anyone figured out how to remove the rear seat squab? Dog accident in my AWD Hybrid Cruiser today so need to remove seat cover to wash it properly and I want to refit the seat cover firmly over the seat squab
Found step by step instructions to remove back seats:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIM9UbmpMsoedit: if that does not load, Google this: youtube remove seat morozov
Many thanks for the link. Unfortunately the construction of the seats for the Australian market Hybrid are slightly different, but I have now figured out that the front of the seat squab lifts up, requiring quite a lot of force to dislodge from the clips that retain it, the hooks at the rear of the seat are similar but there also three seat sensors that must be disconnected. Just a bit of brute force, at the end of the day!
In relation to the Toyota portal, does anyone have any info on how accurate the "Latest Estimated Pick Up Date" is?Our vehicle has just moved to "scheduled for production" and has an estimated pickup date of 12 July.Would be fantastic if it was that quick!
My experience was that it came in a little ahead of schedule. Most other commenters seem to suggest pick up date is pretty correct

Braveheart81 writes...ur vehicle has just moved to "scheduled for production" and has an estimated pickup date of 12 JulYeah. Ours was about 5 days earlier than estimated pick up. That was getting front tint done as well. Probably be built relatively soon and on then on the boat before you know it. 2-3 weeks before landing ( ish ) then to the dealer not long after. Prepped ready for pick up.
How do you activate live traffic in the RAV4?
After much hopping back and forth between the cars on short list, the wife kept referring to the low quality 'etch-a-sketch' like screen in the RAV4, and the two big knobs that point out like 'boobs' (her comment, not mine).   It just did not feel like quality inside.  The drive is let down by the interior.
Dealer just rang and my 2wd Cruiser Hybrid is ready for pick up on Friday. A month early from the advised month wait when I ordered.
VW-Kombi writes...the wife kept referring to the low quality 'etch-a-sketch' like screen in the RAV4, and the two big knobs that point out like 'boobsDunno , I liked etch a sketch when I was younger , and I like boobs now. So sounds like a win win to me ? But in all seriousness there has been mention of the not So great quality of the multimedia set up.  But I was coming from a 17 year old car so I had not much to compare to. I find it OK though.
Tried searching this thread ��� but didnt find anything, what are everyones thoughts on the chances of Toyota Australia bringing in the plug in hybrid version of RAV4?Looking at buying, but no urgency ��� waiting for current car to call it quits, just wondering whether there is a chance of a plug in version
I would say there is more chance of the Lexus NX model change being a plug in than the RAV 4.

Question for the current Hybrid owners. I got my car more than a month ago. I notice that the engine will start 5-10 second after I press "Start" button everyday at first use. I suspect it's to warm up the engine? The engine will be switched off after a few minutes.  Is this normal?

Question for 2wd Cruiser hybrid owners. How does the EV mode work? When I first got the car a month ago, I was able to turn on EV mode when driving below 50km/h. But lately, I can't get it to work even when driving at 10-20km/h and the EV mode indicator light comes on. Something about exceeding speed range. Is this normal?

Seems still to be in hot demand. Parents got quoted 49k on road for AWD hybrid Cruiser and a few minor extras
We could  have the plug in hybrid available to order by year end.  Toyota UK said sales should commence in September. That could mean 2021 delivery. The wait queue could get quite long or even sell out."The RAV4 Plug in Hybrid has boosted electric power, expected 0-100kph in 6.2 seconds ��� rapid off the line acceleration, & in EV mode can travel up to 65km."

Hi all. Test drove a RAV4 on Saturday. I found there was a LOT of stuff on the dash that was distracting. Does anyone know how much can be turned off, in terms of settings?School zones alert, lane departure alert, etc. Or maybe someone can point me to the operation manual so I can have a read?

Does the Owners Manual say you can fit snowchains ��� insurance implications.We have always carried them for our AWD GXL's (around $200 used). You could hire them "when required" (eg: from BP Jindabyne if they have them, but ring first). If you have 2WD, chains are not normally required to be carried in Thredbo or Bullocks Flat ski tube. But chains can be "required" on the worst/blizzard days ��� with snow & ice even in Jindy. It's also worth researching snow & ice driving tips if you haven't done it before. Rules are different should you be going to Victoria.
Yep, driven in the snow with chains a bit here and in NZ.The manual says 10mm clearance, and you can use them. We have the AWD Hybrid Crusier. Just finding all the sites only suggest two Konig types easy fit suv ($700) or spider chains which aren���t allowed at some Vic resorts.would really like to only spend 200-300 if possible.
V2 Traction snow chains are in that price range. With highway tyres the 12mm chain should work. 18 inch wheel should be okay, don't know about 19 inch tyre width. Try putting your hand across and behind the tyre to gauge the gap with suspension strut  ��� 22mm (or measure if possible).  V2 Traction chain sizing charts are online with one supplier in Qld.

Hi All, Looking at RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid AWD aswell. A dealer quoted 51K for it, we didnt negotiate as we just wanted to get a feel of the price and the sales person dealing with us. He also mentioned to us that coming July price is going up by 1300$. Also folding mirror upgrade is coming in Aug but if we put the order before June we cannot get this upgrade.This drove us to look at other SUV's, as in todays day at this price range that should be added in.What sort of price have others got for similar model recently I am based in WA. Reading through this thread i saw lowest was 46.5k approx.
Isn���t 51k above RRP? Does that include extra like a tow bar?
In WA with Metallic paint RRP is about $51k ��� check it on Toyota website.  I'm from WA too and from experience if you ask for a price, most of them will just quote the RRP.  The question is how much you're able to bargain from there, from what I gather based on other recent posts, 5% discount is considered good nowadays.
I have read on this thread that due to long wait time dealers are allowing to cancel the orders. If this is the case do we need to put any condition when we make the offer. Trying to understand how this works.
tama2 writes...He also mentioned to us that coming July price is going up by 1300$. Also folding mirror upgrade is coming in Aug but if we put the order before June we cannot get this upgrade.Yeah calling bs on that. If you put the order in late June, I don���t imagine your car will be built for at least two to three months, minimum. Therefore you���ll get the FY20 price and also the folding mirrors. Even if you don���t get it, I imagine you can buy a genuine Toyota part yourself and get them to install it for less than $1.3k.
When you sign up for the contract agree on a delivery date and include it as a condition.  The Terms and Conditions of Sale (just checked mine) has a "Purchaser's right to terminate this contract" section which contractually allows you to terminate it and get the deposit back.
becomes useful if they "revalue" your tradein, which they said can also be done (after many months waiting).

The white colour code 040, described on the RAV4 as Glacier White is the standard white that you would recognize from pretty much every Toyota for many years. I personally think it is the standard colour for a Tyota AWD, as is British Racing Green for Jaguars and Silver for Mercedes, or red for a Ferrari

I���m looking at the Gxl hybrid front wheel drive and was told today 7 month wait from my local dealer. It was a nice drive but coming from a sedan I noticed the car dips a bit towards the front when braking. Nothing crazy but enough to notice.
Hybrid braking is apparently a bit different.
Just a question about setting the adaptive cruise control speed to the displayed road speed signs.  Is it possible and what button sequence do you needy press?

If it's possible to set to the speed of the road sign, a green box outline appears around the speed sign, with either a down or up arrow.Hold -/Set if the down arrow is shown, Hold +/Resume if the up arrow is shown. A tap of the buttons doesn't work, must be a hold.
Might pull the plug on the 2WD hybrid cruiser. I���ve called around, everyone just quotes the prices on the website; no discount. I asked for mats and tint etc, they seem to Jack the price up. Weird
Try a couple of  brokers,  should get at least fleet price. Then reassess.
KevinBacony writes...I���ve called around, everyone just quotes the prices on the website; no discount. I asked for mats and tint etc, they seem to Jack the price up. WeirdYou must not appear adamant enough. Every dealer will quote the RRP to you if you're ringing around and don't appear adamant. They probably give quotes like these literally hundreds of times a day.Make an offer with a price you're actually willing to pay (no tyre-kicking), and say you'll give them your CC details immediately if they accept. They might require a photo of your CC to prove you're serious, before even bothering to get up from their seat to get the OK from the manager on duty. This is the level of commitment you'll need to show in order to get the best price.Also, get the tints elsewhere. They'll cost $150 at most, but the dealership will charge you three times that amount for the luxury of them taking care of it for you.Mats and a tank of petrol should come free, no dealer should charge for them and they're stupid to lose a sale just because they don't chuck them in when it costs them <$100 cost price.
Is there any point waiting for 2021?Spoke to a dealership today, apparently they got an internal update in that there���s a 1-4% increase across all Toyota cars come 1st July.

Today one Australian dollar buys 74 Japanese Yen, after dipping to 64 Japanese Yen in March 2020.Toyota ��� and most other car makers ��� have ridden the wave of currency fluctuations, but now it is passing some of the cost on to buyers.The Toyota price list shows hybrid models will rise by the greatest margin, as demand continues to exceed supply of petrol-electric variants.The Toyota Prius ��� which pioneered hybrid technology ��� will go up by $800.Currently the waiting list for a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid stretches up to 10 months, however Toyota has told CarAdvice it is trying to find a fairer way of allocating cars and shortening waiting lists.Interestingly, the Toyota RAV4 and Toyota C-HR are the only models where the price for both petrol and hybrid variants will increase by the same amount (by $1300 on the RAV4 and by $750 on the C-HR).In all other examples, the price increases for hybrid variants are $500 more than their equivalent petrol-only versions.See the full list below:Toyota Corolla hatchback petrol: up $560Toyota Corolla hatchback hybrid: up $1060Toyota Corolla sedan petrol: up $560Toyota Corolla sedan hybrid: up $1060Toyota Prius: up $800Toyota 86: up $740Toyota Camry petrol: up $700Toyota Camry hybrid: up $1200Toyota RAV4 petrol: up $1300Toyota RAV4 hybrid: up $1300Toyota LandCruiser 200: up $1170Toyota Hiace: up $1100Toyota Hiace Commuter: up $1100Toyota Granvia: up $1100Toyota C-HR: up $750Toyota C-HR hybrid: up $750
I have 2 young kids and am considering either the GX or Cruiser. Can anyone with the GX comment on how easy the fabric seats are to clean? Is it worth spending the extra c.$6.5k for leather accented seats if you have young kids?
Are your kids messy? Price gap between the 2 is not insignificant. Cheapo way is to throw some water proof pet rug over the back seat. Cut holes for seat belt buckle and happy days.
SuperCheap has waterproof throws/covers for pets/kids. (We like our mid-spec GXL hybrid).

brucethebear writes...Interesting to hear that it was a positive experience for you.It is shopping the trade that fills me with dread :)We went for the Cruiser 2WD Hybrid.  Overall the experience of purchasing went well.  I was a bit concerned to start with as the first offer I received was the worst, but thought that may be the norm.  I had a couple of dealers contact me saying ���come back to us with your best offer and we will see what we can do���, but I stuck to my guns with them and said, give me your best offer or you are out of the running.  I then just took the better deal.  I maybe could have played a couple off against each other in the end to get a few hundred more off but thought it was only fair to go with the best offer as that is what I had committed to.  So in the end we only went to 2 dealers, the one where we test drove the RAVs and decided on the model we wanted and then the one we eventually purchased from.

DrKnuckles writes...I assume the slight update with auto-fold mirrors etc, that's what the broker suggested anyway...My understanding is the price increase is their standard price increase at the beginning of every financial year. It covers the new revisions like the folding mirror.

Perhaps a silly question, do you know if installing it voids the warranty at all?I���m sure Toyota would use that as their ���defence��� not to honour warranty. But the beauty of this system is that it is plug and play and can be removed easily and the car is taken back to original. So if I had to send the car for a warranty claim, I would disconnect and remove the Trac from my car first. Fingers crossed I never have to do that.
Called a few more dealers and managed to get a GX hybrid in Glacier White for $36,400. Mats, cargo liner and full tank of petrol. Delivered end July.There seems to be a few GXs available in white if you want to buy before the price rise. Not the colour I wanted but it'll do.

Reckon it was less than 30 minutes. You only need a pair of scissors to cut some adhesive velcro strips and a philips head screwdriver. Included in the pack is a trim removal tool.OOTB the module is set to close or open the mirrors when the doors are locked/unlocked. Whether via the remote or by holding you finger on the door handle, the mirrors close/open.You can cut the grey wire that's in the included harness, so that the mirrors move when the ignition is turned on or off. I chose not to do that.I have the car set to lock the doors when driving, the mirrors do not fold in in that case.You can still use the mirror switch to fold the mirrors in or out as usual. If the switch is set to close them & you lock the car, when the car us unlocked, the mirrors open. For me it was worth it & I would recommend.

Well, after looking around extensively and climbing in and out of countless cars we have decided to upgrade our 11 year old much loved falcon wagon to a new RAV4. Nothing too exciting, just a base GX 2WD petrol auto in graphite, the test car we looked at was graphite and although it isn't a colour we would normally consider, we loved it on the RAV4. Amazed at the room inside the RAV4 and it is a great height for me getting in and out with my dodgy old knees and back. And we love the safety features even in the base model.After looking around at cars we are over running around caryards and just not up for playing the negotiating game with multiple dealers, so after seeing recommendations on this thread we have decided to give Motor Scout a go at finding a good deal for us. Will provide some feedback on how we find them.

I made an enquiry on behalf of a family member for a RAV4 Hybrid. The quote they provided was $1500 more expensive than what my cousin got himself so we ended up not proceeding with his offer. The whole experience was pleasant. The agent was helpful and not pushy at all. He was happy to learn that we scored a good deal somewhere else

It all happened very quickly, a few days at most. Your dealer, if competent, should be able to tell you if you made this month���s build.Mine is scheduled for July 21 pickup and went through the statuses about a week ago. Yours is early August so I assume it���ll go into production in a few days.
Hi, Which dealers did you get the GX hybrid in Glacier White for $36,400 (Mats, cargo liner and full tank of petrol. Delivered end July).
Hi Guys,New here. Just booked a Hybrid Cruiser AWD Eclipse Black in Melbourne for 47900. Anyone getting any better offer since its the last day of EOFY and price rise coming as well.

Yes...its locked on paper..car will be delivered around mid August..so i assume production in july. Yet to get batch/order number
Prices on the Toyota website have gone up $1300 + stamp duty, as promised. However there is no mention of additional tech. No longer sure the Rav4 is better value than a CRV or CX-5 with this price hike.

No chance of $50k considering the RAV4 is already at that price. The Prime is marketed as a much better beast than the Rav4 Cruiser in the US so you can expect it to cost a fair bit more.

Something that might interest those who have recently changed from Nutmeg to black interior or are still awaiting their Nutmeg build (interesting stuff).For the months of June and July, we have had a much-anticipated increase in the supply of RAV4 Hybrid to assist us in clearing the backlog of COSIs outstanding in the network and allowing stock vehicles to be made available for the network.Whilst we have been making our production side aware of requirements to clear COSIs with the rapid rise of production made available to TMCA, our production facilities have been unable to increase the level of Cruiser LA40 Nutmeg interior trims at the speed that overall production has increased.Unfortunately, this LA40 Nutmeg trim restriction was only realized after pulling forward the August and September vehicles into July production (as per region planning bulletin RP 018/20).Due to the limited production of Nutmeg interior we had to push many COSIs we could not fill with production from July into August production (where they remain at A00).As such when produced, these will be a Tech Change vehicle and be subjected to GPI and any spec change related price increase. In the interests of the guests, TMCA will exercise discretion and not apply the GPI or any spec related price increase for the COSIs created by 18th June (date new tech change material code went live in SAP) for RAV4 HV Cruisers LA40 Nutmeg trim.
SLedGE writes...and any spec change related price increase.Following the price increase on July 1 are dealers including the full increase to existing and new quotes for the Cruiser Hybrid 2WD Silver. (DA was $46841 now $48196)
Is anyone recharging the 12v battery located near the spare?  Seems that the US has had issues with batteries dying (hybrids).
For anyone who received a 2020 Rav4, did Android Auto just work plug n play? I just took delivery of a 2020 Camry and it doesn't seem to be working. Just directs me to download the Toyota Link app. Wondering if there's any particular setting I have to enable in the menus. The Camry thread seems to be dead, that's why I'm asking here.
biggero writes...Following the price increase on July 1 are dealers including the full increase to existing and new quotes for the Cruiser Hybrid 2WD Silver. (DA was $46841 now $48196)We just bought a new 2020 GX 2WD petrol auto today and managed to get a car from existing stock that was received and invoiced to the dealership prior to 1 July so the price increase did not apply. Our car is at the other end of the model tree, but from our experience it appears that it depends on the date the car was supplied and invoiced to the dealership from Toyota Australia.
my estimated delivery date to dealer just came forward by a week.. weird.. well that's good news. 16/7 at the moment.
I may be wrong but our RAV4 is on the freighter 'Trans Future 5' which docks in Brisbane tonight. Then NSW a few days after then VIC a few days after that. Give it a week to get to the dealership and getting it all prepared and mid this month seems like a bang-on estimation.

Questions for the dealer/Toyota employees. Is there a more significant 2020 RAV4 revision coming out in September?Toyota has posted some messages on some of the website vehicle tracking pages indicating a new model in September 2020. I understand this may just encompass the current model with the auto folding mirrors, but can anyone confirm if there are any other improvements?I've seen some posts referring to a switch from NiMH to Li-ion batteries. The Corolla hatch hybrid gets 4.2l/100k vs the newer Corolla sedan hybrid getting 3.5l/100k, is this a differentiation between an NiMH and Li-ion battery, and could this better battery technology be seen in the 'new model' for Sept 2020?The newer Corolla sedan also has a Head Up Display. Is this something we could expect in an updated RAV4?These improvements would appear to be more justification for a $1300 price rise, rather than just auto folding mirrors. Anyone in the business with any further insight?
Guys,Do you think $45k is decent offer to chase for a 2WD Cruiser with metallic paint? That is a 9% discount.
Bedford writes...The newer Corolla sedan also has a Head Up Display. Is this something we could expect in an updated RAV4?Wouldn't have thought the HUD would be standard on the Corolla base model as my wife's ZR Sports has it.A HUD would definitely be a welcome addition to the RAV4 as the speed sign detection coupled with the speedometer is awesome when you see it without taking your eyes off the road.
Been offered $49.5k as the best price I can find for a graphite AWD cruiser hybrid DA with mats, cargo mat, full tank, bonnet protector and cage in the back and tinting for the front windows.I am tempted to negotiate harder but no one is even moving close to this, and this is with a vehicle from cancelled order on the way end of August so guaranteed delivery inside of 2 months.Should I take it or hold out? This price rise and new financial year has sapped dealerships desire to negotiate up here.

Keep in mind the auto-fold mirrors came standard in overseas models, Toyota Australia just decided to butcher it from models here (probably to deliberately make it less appealing than the Lexus).Following the pattern, I think we���ll see these features in the next iteration: heated steering wheels, tyre pressure monitor and heated back seats (these features all exist in overseas models). Maybe air conditioned front seats in line with the Edge.
MintyPringle writes...Been offered $49.5k as the best price I can find for a graphite AWD cruiser hybrid DA with mats, cargo mat, full tank, bonnet protector and cage in the back and tinting for the front windows.Unless you actually want the bonnet protector and cage, I���d remove them. Likewise with tinting. They���ll prob charge you $500 or so when it really shouldn���t cost more than $200 to do.A tank of petrol and mats come free (from Toyota HQ) with every Toyota.

Has anyone been able to get a good deal on a Rav4 Gx 2wd Hybrid since July 1?  The prices have risen significantly (as detailed in this thread), with no extra features (old spec models).  New spec will be even more.  We were offered a decent deal for a graphite in the old spec (~37.4k) but the dealer then pulled out as they 'made a mistake' and used the old prices.  Now offering $38,990 for the same car, a Graphite Gx Hybrid 2wd.  I'm struggling to work out if this is actually a reasonable price or if because it's just the start of the FY, they aren't that keen to sell for a lower price just yet.
Brian McGee writes...You might strike gold, back in Feb I scored a RAV4 AWD Cruiser for $45.3k driveaway.

We got 2 levels of quote back, a couple really good and a couple quite a bit higher on basically the same car. From what the winning bidder told me, it appears the ones quoting low were quoting on stock on hand that was delivered to them and invoiced by Toyota Australia prior to 1 July when the price rise became effective. This approach probably would not work though for a hybrid model which are in short supply.
Jastone writes...You would think that they would be keen to move units given the unemployment situation, tighter car finance lending, etc.  perhaps that hasn't hit them yet (or the RAV is the exception!).Ironically Toyota Australia made more sales in March/April 2020 than the same time last year.

I'm 99% sure you need "spec 3" in order to have the latest upgrade, which is the auto-folding mirror. And anything ordered to be built after 1 July will be "spec 3" (unless of course it's floor inventory).If they charged me the post July price I'd be damn certain they give me a freshly made Rav, not one sitting in their car yard for who knows how long. TBH I reckon what's happening is they are 1) using the 'new' prices to justify a price increase and 2) selling you the luxury of not having to wait 2 months for it to be built.

Drop Bear writes...The auto fold in mirrors would have been the only real upgrade im desperate for.. am going to have to go after market for thatThe aftermarket is only $99 so you are way ahead of spending an additional $1300 to get folding mirrors.

Correct me if I'm wrong but the auto folding mirrors don't exactly function the way that Toyota would have it implemented...? Or is exactly the same? I don't think anyone in Australia has received the spec 3 model yet so we don't know for sure if its the same implementation.Its a good feature to have but im not sure i want to get inside the door trim and remove bits and pieces or get anyone else to do it for that matter.

Drop Bear writes...im not going to uninstall and reinstall the damn thing once a year for servicesA warranty claim rejection by the dealer, should only be based on your upgraded part being responsible for the failure. If it's been installed and operating for some time, it's unlikely to break something else in the future. Seems low risk, the bigger risk of breaking something may be installing or uninstall it (annually).

SmellyTofu writes...Did they do anything else about the moo noise?Not yet, it will have go back for a couple of days, all upper trims/roof lining need to be removed so they can determine what's causing it. That's for the sunroof noise. In case you're referring to the sound the AWD actuator makes (yes it does sound like a cow, lol), not yet either.
Drop Bear writes...@Drop Bear ��� has your RAV been delivered to the dealer yet?The dealer rang me this morning..

Looks like it takes a week these days from getting off of the ship and to the dealer.. :(He said a week monday is more likely for our pickup date.
ours was three or four weeks from ship arriving, April>May.  Mainly due to dealer staff working a three day week and a lot of vehicles queued for delivery in front of us.

So test-drove a GX Hybrid FWD yesterday, the pick-up was smooth however I drive with a heavy foot and could hear the car struggling under hard acceleration (also some kind very slight vibration could be felt) but when back to cruising speeds, everything good. ECO mode felt the smoothest. Could it be the test car I drove or is this how the CVT works? ( have no prior experience of driving a CVT).Why would one go for AWD over FWD and vice versa ��� does the slight power uptake 160/163 matters OR are there some other benefits that I have overlooked? The car would be primarily be used for school pick up and drop-offs and in a few years for my son who would turn 16. I was quoted $46500 for Cruiser FWD non-metallic, with Dashcam, mats, a tank full, and $49,500 for Cruiser AWD metallic -DA ��� Car in stock (both white ��� Sydney). Are these good prices ��� white is not my color of choice but the partner likes it.Really impressed with the space in the car. it's a bummer that the passenger side has no electric seat adjustments (even after spending >$45k??) Heard that the upcoming auto-folding feature can be DIY for $100. Any other feature that I should wait for in the SPEC 3 version coming from Aug onwards as my current Car rego is due in Sep/Oct 2020 and preference would be change before that. TIA
I say go with the AWD. You get more towing power and gives you more versatility if you ever want to go on non-paved surfaces. Also AWD will give you greater traction in the wet. When it comes time to sell you'll also sell it for a higher price.I wouldn't get the dashcam from Toyota. You can get it done yourself and save hundreds.

$46.5 is about the going rate for a Cruiser FWD before the price rise and for not waiting 9 months like I did albeit they were much more willing to do deals back in Oct 19 though my price was quoted in Jun 19.With the camera, I guess the fall back is that if anything is up, you can throw it back to them.
Hi AllJust curious as to how the usb ports perform with charging phones?  Are they fast charge compatible? Does the wireless charge do fast charge as well? And i am assuming all the ports are type A.. the rectangular ones.  Thanks.
Has anyone bought one since the price rise? Are dealers still as negotiable as they were before?I have an invoice from a friend from April, but slightly different specs (2wd vs awd, different accessories but both in Cruiser) which has a good price on it, so wondering whether it'd be a realistic target (with adjustments for different accessories, AWD, price increase) or not.Also, for those who bought in 2019, was it possible to specify a 2020 build and was the dealer receptive to this?A 2021 build would work perfectly for me (feb/march delivery) but also don't want to be penalised by a higher price, etc.
give it a month, them most of the dealers will have floorstock and some negotiations could possible.
lazydesi writes...give it a month, them most of the dealers will have floorstock and some negotiations could possible.The more popular models are built to order, and it makes sense Toyota dealers don't really want to keep many cars as floorstock. They know that despite people having to wait literally months, it's still the best selling SUV in Australia and chumps like us are happy to wait.Me. writes...Has anyone bought one since the price rise? Are dealers still as negotiable as they were before?If you put yourself in the shoes of the dealers, you'll realise they have next to no incentive in discounting by more than a few hundred dollars and that's if they are desperate. The price rise affects the dealership's cost as well so I highly doubt they'll be happy to absorb it. Also doesn't help Toyota is going gangbusters even in this climate (they did better in March/April 2020 than March/April 2019), it's not like they're begging for sales.There's no '2021' spec RAV4, in fact it might be built in 2021 but will have 2020 specs. IMO it'll be easier getting blood from a stone than getting a Spec 3 Toyota with last FY prices.DMKory writes...Just curious as to how the usb ports perform with charging phones?

Has anyone who already have their rav4s got the nudge bar installed?How much were you charged for it? What are your thoughts on it?Thinking of getting the nudge bar added on our Graphite Cruiser.
I'm not really sure what purpose a nudge bar serves tbh. Seems like a half baked attempt at a bullbar. Toyota claims it helps with knocks and bumps which might be true if you're driving at 2km/hr.
Robjess writes...What���s the going price to get a towbar installed to a rav4 AWD cruiser?i got the towbar, ball, wiring harness and side weather strips for $910 + GST so a grand.
I saw one with a chrome bull bar the other day, really seems to suite the new shape.
One reason for the nudge bar is to mount an LED light bar.
Just arranged pickup for my car on Saturday morning. Very excited.Apparently the dealer have 6 going out the door on Friday.
We had our car delivered on Friday. Super happy with it so far. Did a drive to Wollongong yesterday (from Sydney) so got a bit of highway driving as well.Now I need to RTFM and work out all the functions/buttons.
Hi Brian,  If you talking about the auto fold mirrors, you can visit this site:https://tracelectronics.com.au/shop/auto-folding-mirror-module-suits-toyota-rav4-2019-onward/You can but it for $99.00 and install it yourself in under 20mins.

Drop Bear writes...i got the towbar, ball, wiring harness and side weather strips for $910 + GST so a grand.Have a look at the price of the car. You���ll find that great price for those 3 items was subsidized/hidden by the higher price of the vehicle.
namhsirIrishman writes...If you talking about the auto fold mirrors,When people first posted this I was really interested but then I realised that there is a button to fold the mirrors in (I didn't have the car at that point and assuming it was just manual).I don't really get why it's so desirable. The only time I would really bother folding in the mirrors is if I'm parked in a car park or a narrow street which isn't all that often. Not that much effort to press the button in those situations.
Robjess writes...What���s the going price to get a towbar installed to a rav4 AWD cruiser?Supplied and install or just install? eBay sells the genuine one for $875 from one of the more digitally savvy dealers.Personally looking at the fitting instructions and design, I���d go the Hayman Reese one as it doesn���t require you to remove/throw away the rear crash reinforcement bar whereas the genuine does.Both require cutting of the bumper which is a necessary evil so that it doesn���t affect the departure angle.

Might be interested.You are 100% certain that the front camera is blocked by adding this accessory? I would have thought Toyota would need to outline that somewhere if it were to be so but i havent seen anything in their documentation that says front camera is partially blocked by adding nudge bar. This is Toyota's exact wording on the nudge bar:This Nudge Bar is specifically tailored for your RAV4. Its design helps provide protection from everyday knocks and bumps whilst integrating with the vehicle���s bold look.The Nudge Bar has been subjected to Toyota���s rigorous strength, durability and environmental testing to ensure its long-term effectiveness whilst the unique bracket system has been developed in tandem with the vehicle to help ensure correct deployment of airbags to give you peace of mind. It is also compatible with the vehicle���s sensors.This all seems to suggest nothing would be hampered by adding this accessory?
so unlike previous models, led light bar could only be mounted low, in bumper bar.

youngyeezy writes...You are 100% certain that the front camera is blocked by adding this accessory?It blocks it a bit. The front camera is over 180 degrees viewing angle so you���re going to see some of the protrusion. The accessories development dept would have deemed it acceptable. As for the light bar, it has been said that it���s not appropriate to fit one due to the clearance to the radar sensing area.Take it however you want but if I was going to fit a light bar, I���d do it under the nudge bar between the number plates.Other ways people in Japan do it is to use the front crash bar as the mount for a solid light bar location instead of a nudge bar (which they can���t get anyway)
what prices are people getting for a GX Hybrid...?
SmellyTofu writes...It blocks it a bit. The front camera is over 180 degrees viewing angle so you���re going to see some of the protrusion.

I have the car and the front camera can see the bumper in the viewing angle. It's not huge so I'm not blowing it out of proportion but it's there. Problem becomes being able to see the contrast between the black covers vs black road if you're using the camera as a guide as the camera/display is pre-iPhone 3G quality.
I had the nudge bar installed on my 2020 Rav 4 Cruiser prior to pickup. The front parking sensors are passed through to the front of the nudge bar. The front camera is approx 70mm back and 100mm higher than the front of the nudge bar. All sensors and cameras work fine and the vision from the camera is not impeded in any way that I can see.Gazza
Has anyone ever explored the option of getting a Toyota freighted to another interstate dealership? My RAV is soon ready for pickup but I can't travel there as it's in a hotspot area.
went into a dealer today to have a look at the gx hybrid...didn't even have a test vehicles either.anyway the dealer confirmed that the gx will be coming with the smart entry lock in september/october...also he wouldn't give much of a discount either...car RRP was $42,000 he only went down to $41,000 pretty pathetic.

went to another big dealer today....wow no price budging at all..he said the best he can do is a few hundred dollars off.ohhh well just have to wait...but yeah I do like the hybrid...its not bad...the infotainment is a big crappy, and the stereo too (on the gx/gxl) but its bearable..now its a waiting game to get the best price.

Anyone changed their reverse light bulbs to LEDs? Any suggestions on which LED bulbs to use and where from?
T15 bulbs are the reverse lights. T20 for indicators. But anyone old one from eBay or spend up and get brand name ones like philips.
Wrrr writes...Anyone changed their reverse light bulbs to LEDs? Any suggestions on which LED bulbs to use and where from?You will probably get hyperflashing if you just switch the regular halogen bulbs to LEDs. The fix is to use a resistor but this may overheat the surround and melt it. I've done a fair bit of research into this myself.As an aside, I have replaced the interior lights and fig lights with LED. Also done the auto fold mirror myself.

Hi folks,Can you check my math below please. Something does not make sense to me... The guys in US test drove the new RAV4 Prime PHEV in a mixed driving pattern circle. The video is here:https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=9TBjGRR-8kkHe basically started with nearly full charge of 18KWh hybrid battery and full fuel tank, drove for 71.3 miles, and topped up the fuel tank with 0.821gallon of petrol, then calculated the consumption as 0.821/71.3 => 86.8 miles from one US gallon (the guy actually calculated 89, I don't know how, but it is close enough), which in our terms converts to a stunning 2.64L/100km.However, he finished with the pretty much empty hybrid battery, so the cost of charging the 18KWh battery should be added. Considering the efficiency of the charger, let's say we need 20KWh from the power outlet. Note that's for 71.3 miles (115km). For 100km, we would need 17.5KWh.I compared the current prices of petrol (0.73US$/L) and electricity (0.15US$/KWh) in Colorado, so roughly 5KWh is equivalent of 1L of fuel, in terms of consumption cost, and therefore 17.5KWh required charge equates to extra 3.5L of petrol per 100km. For Sydney, those numbers would be as follows:The current price of petrol is (1.2AU$/L) and electricity is (0.3AU$/KWh) , so roughly 4KWh is equivalent of 1L of fuel, in terms of consumption cost, and therefore 17.5KWh required charge equates to extra 4.3L of petrol per 100km.So, after you add (even in Colorado) those extra 3.5L/100km to the calculated 2.64L/100km, you'll end up with over 6L/100km. In Sydney, it works out close to 7.In my Cruiser Hybrid, I am easily getting 5.7 and many others here reported less.What's the point in PHEV if it works out to be less efficient? Ecology?Or maybe my math is wrong? Am I missing something? Maybe if you charge at the dedicated charge station, the KWh will cost you much less?Please comment.
the quoted mileage from battery was 42 miles.in the video he got 31 miles (uphill) and 50 miles (downhill) from batteryhttps://www.toyota.com/rav4prime/features/mpg/4544/4550coming back to calculations, the quoted fuel economy per gallons (gasoline) is correct.the cost to travel  71miles is different as it includes cost to topup the battery + cost of gasoline.coming back to combined fuel economy (gas + battery) will also vary, we need to include the total mileage from battery + mileage from hybrid ( in hybrid scenario if the battery is charged enough the power will come from battery instead of gasoline)

Dunno.I have heard of some additions to the normal electricity plans, where you get a separate meter installed for the charher, then you pay a dollar a day, and that covers you for that the consumption of that meter does not go towards your electricity bill. The other way of saying this is for $30 a month you get an unlimited charge source.

Of course, how long you drive between refuels/recharges matters, as for example if you go less than 42miles between recharges, your fuel consumption will be 0.I guess, the long term average will give you a reasonably accurate number. But if we talk about that particular video I posted, then I am not overly impressed with the $/km value of Prime PHEV, which works out to be more than that of my Cruiser. Don't forget that the guy said it was a basic model and the price was US$48K. In Oz, the cruiser variant of it will be (I am guessing) around AU$75K which is almost double the price.

So the auto folding mirrors with spec 3 just folds when car is locked right? The older model folds when you hit the folding switch manually?
went to another big dealer today....wow no price budging at all..he said the best he can do is a few hundred dollars off.ohhh well just have to wait...but yeah I do like the hybrid...its not bad...the infotainment is a big crappy, and the stereo too (on the gx/gxl) but its bearable..now its a waiting game to get the best price.I bought the GX Hybrid Glacier White 2WD in Feb 2020  for $37 000.With the recent price hike of $1300 that brings the current spec price to $38300?Should be achievable if you can find a dealer willing to budge? If you're in Sydney I can PM you the dealer.
The Edge has been in service the last couple of days to have its driver's seat cushion trim replaced for the second time and the complete removal of all upper interior trims and roof lining to rectify a clunking sunroof.Has to go back again for the "mooing" all wheel drive noise, complete transfer case replacement required.Sigh...

Most of the time when showing down, regen are your brakes if the batteries aren���t close to 77-80% ceiling limit.

Gone were the days where they do million of miles in extreme conditions before letting the car out to customers. They might be trying out the Tesla philosophy and treating car as software projects.
It���s also bloody expensive manufacturing nowdays like places like Japan. So costs must be razor thin
Drivetrain is not where you should apply the agile principles to. Software bits yes absolutely.

As always, TMCA sits on their hands and do nothing, wait for customers to complain before doing anything about the issue. They're prepared for it, there's a heap of transfer cases sitting in stock at the Acacia Ridge (Northern Region) parts warehouse.It's a shame we don't get the lemon laws like they do in the US. Quite a number of RAV4 Adventure (similar to the Edge here) owners in the US have successfully got a full refund from Toyota Motor Sales US for ongoing faulty transfer cases. In some cases replaced multiple times only to keep having the issue resurface afterwards.

It's an expensive torque vectoring model if I remember correctly.
Correct and the dog clutch TC is only available with the 2.5 and it���s not available in Japan. It seems to appear when you rack up high 10 to 25,000km so you wouldn���t see it in the blind lights of the new car feeling.Hope the replacement fixes it but reading the rav4world forums, it appears to come back. Only concern is after the 5 years, who���s going to be left dealing with the noise.

Does anyone have any issues with the voice quality of the phone call, when the phone is connected to the car via Bluetooth?A few friends compained to me that my voice comes across to them as disgustingly 'metallic' or 'robotic', and there is a lot of 'artificially sounding' bkgnd noise, on the top of the usual road noise.  At the same time, their voices seem to be OK to me.  When I turn off Bluetooth on my phone and just go through the phone's speaker, those distortions seem to disappear for them, or at least drop down to the level acceptable to the other conversation party.My 2WD Cruiser was manufactured in Aug19 and retrofitted with Android Auto / Apple Car Play in November during the first complimentary service.Note that I am not using AA/ACP when the artefacts above manifest themselves ��� the phone is connected to RAV4 via Bluetooth.

MMC writes...Toyota Australia have said it's not planned for AUOf course they will say that. They want to keep the hybrid sales momentum going. Why wouldn't anyone not prefer a plug-in over a standard hybrid? I was keen on a hybrid to replace one of our Golf 7 diesels. Not so keen now that the Plug-in RAV4 is being manufactured.But sure, the issue will be availability. Only 5000 available out of Japan for all of the U.S. We'll have a long wait unless they can dramatically up production.But one thing is sure. I won't bother with the standard hybrid. Perhaps I could justify a small hybrid?
the Prime PHEV is attractive in the USA because of their EV rebates. in US$ the Prime is around $8K more than the Rav4 Hybvrid, but the rebates come to about 6-8K so it's a no-brainer.Without the rebates in Australia, the Prime PHEV is uneconomical

Anyone know how the sat nav is updated?Can you do it yourself? Is it free etc etc
In my experience using Google maps (Android auto) is so much better that I don't use the inbuilt maps.  I have to plug in the phone but that takes 2 seconds.  Voice commands are much better than the built in nav and it understands things such as nearest bakery....
Umm yeah that's not what I was asking
InternalBleeding writes...Anyone know how the sat nav is updated?Can you do it yourself? Is it free etc etcWill find out on Thursday and let you know then.
Great... Thanks.
I realise that.  But I thought you might like to know that the built in Nav is not very good, so updates may not be needed anyway.
I actually find the built in sat navs are pretty good.. especially mazda's. i prefer the idea of a "stand alone" sat nav, instead of having to have a phone plugged in and have maps not show the speed limits and speed cameras (yes i know waze has it but its not polished like google maps).only thing i'm finding is that with this toyota sat nav...you might need to take it to the dealer to get it updated etc.where as mazdas and some other manufacturers (eg kia/hyundai) you can do it yourself.

Regardless of how good another map source may be. Pretty simple really.My 2012/13 Golf 7 still has yearly map updates available. Updates  for any vehicle navigation system *should* be free of charge. Sadly that isn't always the case.With the choice of vehicles these days, this is one small show stopper for me along with a new vehicle that doesn't come with a DAB+ radio. There is a lot of good competition ��� doesn't take much to point you (me) somewhere else.Spend 50 grand on a car ��� you should get free map updates. Period!
InternalBleeding writes...especially mazda's.Hopefully things have improved. Last Mazda I had was a 2010 CX7 diesel. A map update was going to cost something like $300 IIRC. Consequently in the 5.5 years I owned the vehicle I never updated the maps.And with the screen smaller than an average mobile phone today it simply wasn't worth it. Put me of Mazda a little.

Hi Khaiql, what size festoon light did you use for rear dome lights. Cheers
Hi wrr  I used t20 let's from supernova lighting for front and rear indicators. Will be getting reverse and fog lights from iilumo when reverse lights are in stock
Weird question but why are people changing light bulbs in a new car ? Brightness ? I have a rav and haven���t found any issues where I���d want to change them ? Maybe the front fogs  but that���s for asthetics. I don���t use them anyway.
I should note my old car is 17 years old so not much to go on
Interior lights are awful and don't like the fog lights. That only leaves a couple of lights to change. So why not do them all. Led's are brighter
InternalBleeding writes...that is a very big plus for me...i'm a bit disappointing that most of the skoda cars don't come with dab radio....Seems to be most of the VAG vehicles shipped to Australia lack DAB+. Same RH drive vehicles in UK have DAB+. Offloading old stock? Not acceptable.Will be interested to see if the Golf 8 has it here.Anyway good to see Toyota doing the right thing.
On the subject of lights.  Poor design of boot light should have light on roof. Also , no puddle lights on door and illuminated rav4 plate on front doors jams. Even my old 5 yr old kia had these. Cruiser model should have this stuff.
Interior lights are dim. It���s only $20 for a full set shipped to you anyway.Fogs I always use in fog and rain plus I���ve always had a set of IPF LED in H11 that fit H16. I���ve got a set of rear fogs housing to come from Japan.The other thing is changing the brake lights so that instead of just the 2 outer dots lighting up, the whole rear parking lights also light up therefore expanding the lighting up area. This ���problem��� also was on the CX5 but in Mazda���s wisdom they also light up the parking light area. First few seconds of this install shows you before and after https://youtu.be/eqMD4_yuntE

Anyone know how accurate the toyota tracker is once the car is in the country? The boat our car was on docked in Port Kembla last week i think 22nd or 23rd, how long does it usually take for the car to arrive in metro dealership? Funnily enough the tracker is saying my estimated pick up date is 27/07 lol
at least a week from the port date..they would have to organise transport for thousands of car...get to the dealer..dealer would have to do pre-delivery checks etc.etc..so about a week or two.
Thanks for all the responses re the lightsSomeone mentioned puddleLights ? Our cruiser has them ? Only lights I maybe would change as I mentioned would be the fog  to led , but I don���t use these anyway ? The ��� yellow ��� light doesn���t suit the white light of the headlights / DRL at all. I seem to find the reverse fine at night with the camera.
easyj writes...no puddle lights on doorThere are puddle lights on the side mirrors but they only activate when it's quite dark.  They are also quite dim unless you change them to LED.
Reposting but does anyone know how to change the centre display? When the car starts, so upon start its show the map display and I want it changed so audio stations as the default screen. Would appreciate if anyone knows.

Fog light procedures in manual
Changing bulbs anywhere does nothing to the warranty unless they were the cause of the problem to which you���d go back and undo them to see if they were the cause of the fault. It���s a low risk mod.

After getting a ridiculously high quote for a 3rd party dashcam, I asked the price of the Toyota one in their pamphlet. She said she didn't know and when I asked if she could find out, she gave me some weak excuse and it was obvious she was pushing me to the 3rd party one. Seems to me the dealers push you to the 3rd party one cos they can make a much bigger profit from them.

So it seems Aug-20 build is running lithium batteries.My plus- I will soon have a supply of replacement cells for my 9yo Prius v which to date has been the sole lithium hybrid in the range. Counter is that NiMH will become less common thus less spares come 10-15yrs timeThe minus- Barely having the car for less than a month, I already found out it���s outdatedMe with a level head- If the experience between my Prius hatch vs Prius v, Li-ion makes very little diff other than weight which wasn���t noticeable as the wagon body was much heavier than the hatch- This switch to Li-ion is both unusual mid-cycle must have been some development delays that prevented the RAV4 to start last year using Li-ion- NiMH works better in cold conditions and handles hot conditions better than Li-ion- Li-ion charged noticeable faster using my Prius experience but the Li battery in the Prius v had a smaller capacity than the regular hatch- NiMH is slightly more durable but has memory effect if anyone remembers the old Nokia days- I do notice the RAV4 likes to keep the battery in the high 50% state of charge rather than go up to mid-high 60%Overall, I don���t feel buyers remorse coz I paid relatively little vs what people are paying now pre tech change.
SmellyTofu writes...This switch to Li-ion is both unusual mid-cycle must have been some development delays that prevented the RAV4 to start last year using Li-ionGiven the Camry is also switching to Li-ion mid-cycle and has been in production for longer than the RAV4, I wonder if this is Toyota slowly phasing out NiMH or maybe supply related issues with the battery?
Toyota formed a joint venture with panasonic early this year. this give them an access to LioN stockhttps://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/31477926.html
Access is one thing but I know that they wouldn���t change the hardware without doing rigorous testing (at times very frustrating)  to prove it doesn���t affect other parts of the car. Then there���s the software management component though again with my experience with both of them, both bounce between 40% SoC to 80% SoC so there must be something to cater for the different technology that isn���t as apparent.
SmellyTofu writes...So it seems Aug-20 build is running lithium batteries.So is that confirmed for the rav4 vehicles?Or is there an article somewhere about it? Cause I asked the dealer and he didn't know anything about it
Seems to be from a dealer bulletin some ppl from the dealers received today in the FB groups. But the pressure to increase price is always there from TMC as part of the annual GPI (general price increase) routine they put onto TMCA. If the market can sustain the price rise without detriment to volume, then they���ll do it.Also suspect the push on orders was to clear put all the orders purchased at a lower rate so TMCA aren���t stuck paying for the GPI hike TMC applied to TMCA for Aug builds.
InternalBleeding writes...So is that confirmed for the rav4 vehicles?Or is there an article somewhere about it? Cause I asked the dealer and he didn't know anything about itUnlikely anyone will confirm. Toyota just shipping a few with it to test out reliability in the field.
InternalBleeding writes...So is that confirmed for the rav4 vehicles?I got access to the service manuals a while back (paid subscription) and in the model codes,  there are 3 vehicle types listed.H: Hybrid (Ni-Mh Battery Model)L: Hybrid (Lithium-ion Battery Model)A: Gasoline ModelSo if you check the label on your car, mines a AXAH54R (the H meaning Ni-Mh).The new ones with Lithium-Ion will be AXAL54R.

SmellyTofu writes...Counter is that NiMH will become less common thus less spares come 10-15yrs timeI don't think that'll be an issue, the scale of existing NiMH batteries out there means there'll be a market for replacement NiMH batteries for decades to come.

(EDIT: Seems the answer is 'probably not' ��� https://www.drivingthenation.com/breakthrough-on-toyota-battery-for-electric-vehicle/)If we go back to basics, Toyota (like most Japanese car manufacturers) like using tried and tested tech, so I have faith that whatever tech they use/used will be reliable.

Brian McGee writes...I don't know if NiMH and Li-ion batteries will be interchangeableI���m not talking about swapping battery chemistry but more about the individual cells as I���ve not seen a broken down Prius v Li-ion unit in its individual cells to see the interchangeabilityAs for reliability, I���ve been driving hybrids for 10 yrs and I am confident I won���t need the 10yr warranty. Being an insider when I purchased my Prius, there was enough evidence of the robustness of the system and with more content out outlining how the unit works is one amazing piece of engineering which when you get your head around it is very simple.All I am referring to is the battery changes over time. Doing a check of my NiMH voltage variance, the new RAV4 is at 0.07V whereas both the 11yo Prius and 9yo Prius v is at 0.25V. Still a long way from the 1+ volt variance require before it throws a code. All in all, keep checking the voltage variance, keep the eye on the battery temps and you should be good for many years if well over a decade.

InternalBleeding writes...can anyone who recently received a delivery of their RAV4...check what map version they have?also is there only 1 usb port that can be used either for a usb stick or plugging phone in ? (in GX hybrid model)Yes, GX Hybrid only has 1 USB port. Having said that, we get a lot of 12V standard power ports so you can probably buy some dual USB plugs for those if you definitely need more USB ports. Only the original can be used for Apple Carplay/Android Auto though.I can check Map version a bit later ��� have no idea as I've been using Android Auto.
Snipyro writes...GX Hybrid only has 1 USB port. Having said that, we get a lot of 12V standard power portsPretty sure that's across the range. My GXL is the same and my daughters Cruiser is too I thought.
GXL and above should have 5 USB ports. 2 in the centre console and 2 for rear passengers, 1 up front
Feathers writes...Pretty sure that's across the range. My GXL is the same and my daughters Cruiser is too I thought.I was under the impression that the GX model "cheaped out" by having more 12V ports instead of USB ports in many areas. E.g. under the rear air vents, the GXL and Cruiser should have USB ports, but we have a standard 12V port ��� hence my recommendation to plug in USB charging ports if the original poster preferred USB.Unless you have both USB and 12V? Not too sure.
SmellyTofu writes...5 USB ports. 2 in the centre console and 2 for rear passengers, 1 up frontThe 'USB' ports need to be selectable in the control centre to be considered USB ports.  Otherwise, they're just the 12V power outlets?  I can't stream from any other port or connect AA other than the one above the wireless power pad?
Feathers writes...The 'USB' ports need to be selectable in the control centre to be considered USB ports.Some of the USB ports will be 5V power only, others power + data. No way around that, I'd think.Check the user manual.
Only the one under the HVAC controls charge and used for AA/CP. I have the Carplay2air module connected to the one next to the wireless charger pad as it is the only one that works for CP so I can put my phone anywhere
Pavlov writes...Some of the USB ports will be 5V power onlyTrue, 5V, my bad.  Seems it is only the front one, however on page 419 of the online manual suggests that two devices can be recognised if a USB hub is fitted (to this front port).  All other ports are power only.

Hi Guys,Looking at getting a new Rav4 GXL Hybrid AWD and I am just wondering:1. Would I be in for much of a wait (South Aust)?2. What sort of price can I expect to pay for the above? I am guessing there is not much discounting happening..Thanks.
Dealers are actually getting excess RAV4 Hybrid stock this month.
I think the wait is roughly 1-3 months at the moment.I am picking up my car today after waiting exactly 5 months but the dealer told me when i put pen to paper it would be anywhere between 6-9 months. I am seeing people get cars a month after ordering now.I would highly recommend going for the cruiser model instead of the GXL. For the amount of extras you get the price is worth it and not a big difference in price to go from GXL to Cruiser.
Mezz01 writes...new Rav4 GXL Hybrid AWDwe paid $44.5k (2.5Lt NSW, pre price rise). Could be worth trying several brokers.  Personally we didn't want the Cruiser options & wheels, although it is good value with a deep discount. (It's MrsB's 4th RAV ��� loves it).

Does anyone know if the front USB port (used for Carplay/AA) actually charges? Or if it's just a data port?
Brian McGee writes...actually charges?Definitely charges if you're using an original power + data cable.
Interesting. Pretty sure I was using an MFI cable. Will double check to see if it was charging.
Mine charges and allows for CP. I'd wish I had the option to charge or not so I don't overcharge my phone.

bit the bullet today and placed a order for a GX Hybrid...dealer said takes about 6-8 weeks before they get the info when it going to be produced/build started.nothing was mentioned about auto fold mirrors, but seems like gx gets the extra usb ports, however reduced number of 12v accessory sockets (the old style cigarette one) , also the smart start seems to be for petrol only gx...so dont think the GX/GX Hybrid is getting the smart entry.Delivery for the car ..anything up to 4 months...which is ok....and there is a potential price rise in a month or so..but yeah if the price rise is too much I guess i'd have to cancel the order.
It���s only the Cruiser that gets auto fold. Your hybrid however if it is an Aug build will be using lithium traction battery as opposed to the NiMH off the launch vehicle.
i wonder if with the auto-fold mirror option is just a matter of swapping the "switch panel" in the door draw card.
SmellyTofu writes...Your hybrid however if it is an Aug build will be using lithiumdoes that apply to all the line up models? including the GX/GXL?
InternalBleeding writes...Delivery for the car ..anything up to 4 months...which is ok....and there is a potential price rise in a month or so..but yeah if the price rise is too much I guess i'd have to cancel the order.Didn���t you agree on the price before placing the order? Price rises after the order is placed is not your problem.
703 writes...Price rises after the order is placed is not your problem.There's actually a clause in the contract which states the dealership MAY pass on price rises to the customer. But this is never done in practice.
No, there's a mirror fold ECU associated with it that's currently not available in the pre-Aug20 build and post Aug20 for anything below Cruiser.Btw, I have the auto fold switch from a Crown. It's not as easy as that or else I wouldn't be drawing wiring diagrams to nut it out.
well yeah the price is written on the contract (even though its below the recommended drive away price) but either way..if the price rises you have a right to withdraw...the funny thing though..like i mentioned on the contract/tax invoice the price of the car is below the drive away price...so does that mean the dealer..in theory can pass on the price rise because its already selling the car below the drive away price?You get what I'm saying? It sounds like its a unethical practise but...is that what they are doing?
InternalBleeding writes...does that apply to all the line up models? including the GX/GXL?Yeah, all RAV4 hybrids have moved to Lithium as of Aug build. Model code changed that has L for lithium as opposed to H that denotes NiMH.
InternalBleeding writes...so does that mean the dealer..in theory can pass on the price rise because its already selling the car below the drive away price?Yes they can do that but that's why you listen to your gut/reviews of others who can make recommendations. I got my RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid for well below a price any broker could have gotten me and I picked it up last weekend. What was agreed to was what was paid and accepted.
InternalBleeding writes...does that apply to all the line up models? including the GX/GXL?Generally yes. But it���s not a guarantee. They can put in whatever battery supply they have at the time of the build and just label the chassis number that indicates the type.
Brian McGee writes...What was agreed to was what was paid and accepted.yeah i get ya...so basically its the price at the bottom of the contract...unless you specified in the comments that the price is "locked and not subject to price rises"

I bought the trac kit for $100 and did it myself. Very easy! Works really well and I���m not handy at all.
I can also confirm I did the TRAC kit to get auto folding mirrors for my GX Hybrid model. There's a youtube video of one of the collaborators (who worked with TRAC to design it) installing it into his car and it's pretty easy to follow along.Just keep in mind that when you order the module from TRAC you MUST specify that you have the GX model as for my June build there was no smart entry (only push start button), so the wiring harness was different from the one for GXL and Cruiser models. I ended up having to rewire it myself with some advice from TRAC as I was sent the wrong harness.

He tells me it���s prob not the best idea to do !It depends how much of a stickler the mechanic is when they service your car. It'll be obvious that you installed an aftermarket accessory when they turn off the car. If they don't give a crap then they'll turn a blind eye, if they do they'll probably put a note attached to your VIN saying an after market auto fold component was installed. Or you could just unplug it everytime you get your car serviced.But if it's literally plug and play, it'll take 15 mins tops to install. So I can't imagine it costing too much to do at a Toyota dealership.

I was also wondering about it.
Has anyone's fuel economy gotten better as they driven more of the car? I'm getting about 6.7L/100km. Not that I'm unhappy about that.
I���m around 6.2-6.5 on the first tank.On another topic, has anyone prices up a genuine towbar, wiring harness and tow ball?
Does anyone here have Electric Blue? My favourite colour in the brochure but wondering how it looks in real life.For extras, have people purchased genuine headlight and bonnet protectors, or have you gone after market (or not at all)?My main extra 'want' is the tow bar.
Mine is on 5.8. Driving is a mix of short trips and longer ones with frequent use of the power button especially at lights. Done just over 12000 kms and going for one year service end of August.
Quick question regarding the front facing camera. Mine has a very darkened V shape section (technically a trapezoidish shape). Is that normal and if so, why? You can still see what is in that area but it is super dark and I can't work out what it is for. Happy to take a photo if nobody knows what I am talking about.

On first tank. 2wd cruiser with less than 500 kms.  Around 6.3. In Melbourne the cold weather doesn't help fuel economy petrol engine kicks in on start up and can take at least 5 minutes for electric motor to kick in. Still learning to drive it but you need to be very gentle on acceleration sometimes my speed is too slow for drivers behind. Lol. I found if you have a long stretch at 60kmh you can put cruise on and sometimes ev mode kicks in.I think in warmer weather and more kms under the belt I think I can get 5.5ltr per 100km easily. Not too fussed anyway enjoying the quieter ride as I came from a diesel car. Unfortunately got car in covid lockdown so I can't enjoy driving it. By the way love the sound system.
SmellyTofu writes...You mean the EuroNCAP test?Yep damn impressive, its one of those things ��� you don't believe it until you try it out for yourself.One other thing, inundated with messages about entering and exiting school zones. How do you turn them off?
Is in the audio unit customization. I leave mine on as it���s the only alert Waze doesn���t call out.
has anyone bought the genuine seat covers? i'm curious what kind of quality they are
My fuel economy has been fluctuating wildly ��� anywhere from as low as 4.3L/100km to 6.3L/100km. In total, averaging about 5.8-5.9L/100km total over the 700km or so I���ve driven it.From my experiences so far I notice the following trends:1) If you park your car outside or undercover and don���t have a proper garage, the fuel economy in Winter is significantly worse as EV mode is fairly reluctant to kick in until after a few minutes. For longer trips, it wouldn���t make much difference, but in city driving for maybe 10-20km, it drops your fuel economy noticeably. When I park my car inside the proper garage, this effect is usually much less and I find that it stays in EV mode much earlier/the car can actually use EV mode only at the beginning.2) Slow acceleration for the purposes of keeping the gauge in the ECO area didn���t improve fuel economy much for me ��� I found that if I accelerate normally (not rushing off the lights, mind, just regular acceleration to keep pace with most cars), it would be about the same or sometimes better fuel economy. Not entirely sure why, but I suspect it might be because I get up to speed quicker and then can relax the throttle to get EV mode to appear significantly quicker.The trips where I had 4.3-5.3L/100km were usually not in morning, and were significantly flatter/downhill compared to the 6+L/100km results, which were almost always in the morning cold, or hillier terrain.My overall fuel economy is mid to high 5L/100km so I���m still really happy with the fuel economy overall. My old Corolla with a 1.8L engine and the kerb weight of a modern Yaris was using 10L/100km on the same work commute! Old engines suck for fuel economy ���
Point 1 is a bit mixed. If you start from cold (garage or not), before the coolant warms up to 40C, it will primarily draw from the battery for motive power (waiting for more detail to see how many amps it is drawing but it is higher than normal) despite the engine running coz it���s busy warming up. My morning ritual is to warm up the car till it cuts out (@40C) and then drive it. It only takes a minute at most which is really quick vs Prius.Point 2: What your describing is the pulse and glide method to hypermiling. Youtube the method for how the Prius gang have mastered.Separately what I do notice is the RAV4 4WD (not sure if it���s applicable to FWD given the extra MGR motor) is it rarely uses the friction brakes until it is around 5km/h and below. Capitalise on it gives you the most charge.
SmellyTofu writes...Point 2: What your describing is the pulse and glide method to hypermiling. Youtube the method for how the Prius gang have mastered.Yeah I've heard of pulse and glide hypermiling and how it works, but I probably don't do the accelerate and coast thing as much as the proper hypermilers. I usually just accelerate to the speed limit and then come off the throttle a bit (to only something like 5-10% pressure on the pedal) to encourage it to stay in EV mode instead of using the combustion engine. I tried pulse and glide but wasn't a huge fan of constantly speeding up and slowing down (even though it's probably better for fuel efficiency in a hybrid).

The thing is the hybrid is in that sweet spot of power to weight ratio of over 95kW/ton (my rule of thumb is anything over 85kW/ton is sufficient for everyday driving). Nothing wrong with the 2.0 (77kW/ton) for around town purposes but you need to be a tiny bit conscious of its limitation and limited range particularly if you���re trying to only refill on the cheap days spaced roughly 14 days apart.
Has anyone determined which RON fuel gives them the best fuel economy?
Update on the Edge. Has been at the dealership again for a couple of days to get the transfer case assembly replaced. This is to rectify the horrible "mooing" sound when the active AWD engages/disengages. Driving home tonight, as I slowed to turn into my street, the mooing sound is already back, although a very muffled version of it this time round. I expect the noise to get louder over time, but I won't have to worry about it as it'll be long flogged off.
Engine writes...The normal RAV4 is good, it has the new 4 cylinder range and still wins reviews, but for many the premium for the hybrid would be worth itThe 2019 build had a noisy engine. They cheaped out on noise insulation on the bonnet. And then had transfer case faults.

703 writes...Because the petrol only RAV4 are not very goodI bought the petrol, I personally didn't like the drive of the hybrid. And don't do enough kms to justify it the extra price. But like I said , to me the hybrid was a " weird " drive. The motor coming on in our demo was like a tractor starting up ( may have just been the demo?), and when slowing to a stop it had a weird whining sound, apparently the regen thing. Our demo petrol motor was also more noisy than i would have presumed , but we had to wait 5 months for build and got one with the extra insulation and its very quiet.Im a bloke who has always had powerful vehicles ( still do) but the 2.0 L petrol does what i need it to do. Fine around town and pokes along on the highway more than competent enough. If your doing a few KMS a year, or city driving , I think the hybrid pays for itself over the years. Not to mention obviously better for the environment with the lower fuel usage.
Engine writes...I suspect one day the entire Toyota petrol lineup will be hybrid. Be less complex for inventory. I know at the moment the Camry is only available as hybrid in EuropeI can confirm this is the case. Friend already confirmed that entire show floor by 2025 will be all hybrid vehicles.Hybrid Kluger in May 2021.

I've read anecdotes of people saying 95 gave them the best fuel economy which offset the increase in price from 91.
Nah. Probably $/km, you���re going to win on 91 given the price differential between 91 to 95. 98 fuel is where you get proper drop in consumption.The thing is you���re not going to fill up all that often anyway. Why not use the lower sulphur fuel that produces less H2S and less wear/damage on emission systems?Each to their own anyway. It���s no diff to the engine oil discussion.

Well, not at least on the Lexus hybrids which have a bit more insulation. I have also driven a 2019 Camry hybrid which was quiet.
Maybe it shouldn���t be. But it was enough for my wife to ask me if a siren from an emergency vehicle was coming up in the distance from behind ! Like I said. Probably not all like that.
I  hear the whine when breaking, but honestly don't think it's that bad.  Maybe because I usually have music or something playing at the same time.  I guess we all have different tolerances...
Speaking of sounds. Has anyone notice a sound when opening the door after the car's been off? It's almost like a drilling sound. Lasts a few seconds then goes back to silent.

Drop Bear writes...The GXL has that as well so you might be in luck with the GX.Yup, the GX model has the exact same gear options as the GXL and Cruiser for both FWD and AWD models. AWD models for all RAV4s have the circular knob you turn to select the driving mode, while the FWD models just have 3 buttons and a useless tiny storage space made where the knob would be in AWD models.
Drop Bear, Snipyro, thanks for your help. Jim
I think he means does it have the option of moving the gearstick to manually select a gear. I haven't got my car yet but think I remember from the pictures that I saw + and ��� symbols by the gearsick
What do people think of the following price ? 44.5k for cruiser 2wd hybrid, saturn blue, mats + cargo tray with a 3-4 month wait. It's been pretty hard to haggle the price. Some dealers are saying they can get a rav4 by the end of the month but none have been able to get near that price.
nvm
ringo writes...What do people think of the following price ? 44.5k for cruiser 2wd hybridVery similar to what was being achievable prior to the $1300 price rise?  Seems pretty reasonable to me.
WhirlJim writes...Does the RAV4 GX Hybrid have any forward gear choiceThe plugin hybrid, if we ever get it, will have faster acceleration (0-100 in 6 sec) if that's what you seek. We only use it to hold a low gear for engine braking downhill in the snowfields.

I haven't got my car yet but think I remember from the pictures that I saw + and ��� symbols by the gearsickAh sorry, I see what you/they mean.Yes there is a gear selector if you push the gearknob to the right. This lets you do the usual "manual" shifting that a lot of cars offer. Having said that, I never use it as with a CVT it's all simulated and doesn't seem too useful for me. The hybrid model already has a lot of shove as soon as you push the accelerator so launching is never too slow for me.
HiCan someone recommend a cheapish obd2 reader that can be used with mobile phone. Carista seems to be a good one.. but it has a yearly subscription fee. Wondering if they are all like that?ThanksDM
I���ve had cheap OBD readers and work ok but I dropped it from 1M and somehow crapped itself. I now have a veepeak branded one which apparently is recommended by the DrPrius app that I use. Given I use it often on the cars I service, I guess it���s a matter of buy once, buy right even though it is 2-3x more exxy than the knock offs.
Hi,We're thinking of going for the custom dash cam instead of the Toyota one since the default does not have both front and back cameras. The custom one however is at a whooping $1399, and I haven't heard of the brand really (GNET N2). Would love to hear from anyone who knows more about this, specifically if they have some feedback or info on GNET dashcams.Thanks.

Brian McGee writes...Check your insurance PDS as to what���s required to not pay an excess.Yeah I'm aware that lots of insurance companies require the details too, but if the dashcam can capture the registration, you can at least bring the footage/rego details to police to see if they can/are willing to help. I know a couple of people were able to capture the registration + recording of the face and this was enough for police to pursue and give details as it's an illegal hit and run.It's not going to be enough 100% of the time, agreed, but probably better than nothing when someone does do a runner!

From there, the installers are fantastic and keep it super clean under the trim/lining so that you can't tell at all. It practically looks stock! I was very impressed with the job and thought it was fantastic value. On eBay the whole set was $579 so it was basically $100 for installation from my perspective (though I'm sure they can get lower factory prices).If you're interested (and in Sydney) I can PM you their number? I'm sure they'd welcome more referrals! Otherwise if not in Sydney, have a look on Gumtree for your local area and there should be some installers.
The challenge is having enough length of cable. I did mine but the shorter wite to the rear camera meant I had to have exposed wiring. It���d be an easy job with the sufficient length wiring.

Clean the inside of your window real well free of oils and effects of the new car plastics gassing out.

Interesting, how does the A/C compressor work on these hybrid cars. On a petrol car it runs on a belt off the crankshaft but if you are running on pure electric what is driving it? If its running off the electric motor then surely that is going to limit your electric range if you never turn the A/C off.
dad writes...Interesting, how does the A/C compressor work on these hybrid cars.No idea :-), sounds like an engineering question.   I've not turned it off since I picked it up over a year ago.  30,000 done now and average 5.7 ��� 5.8 LAnd it's still never fogged up.
dad writes...Interesting, how does the A/C compressor work on these hybrid cars.The A/C compressor is electric (inverter type). If you look under the bonnet, you'll see a dedicated orange cable going to the compressor. It's mounted in the same position on the engine as the conventional belt-driven counterpart in the petrol-only version of the A25A 2.5L.

Depending on the temp set, it could draw as little as 0W (ie off) to 2000W. The higher end is typically when the car is trying to cool the car in a hot interior and you will hear the AC motor going hard.

Instant success and many klm travel without any annoying sounds.Now I have to say that I haven't gotten around to actually finding the exact source of the problem and my fix looks crap with the surrounds being held up off the main centre console but I am at least a happy driver now.It is on my to do list to do a proper repair but what I have works so I'm in no hurry.If I knew how to post a photo or vid on this site I would?

Thinking about buying a new rav4 and need some advice regarding hybrid or petrol only.I currently drive a 2014 model rav4 to work. I do 110km per day and fuel economy tends to be 7.1/100km with 98 petrol.Most km will be on the freeway, so I am wondering if the hybrid is worth it.Thanks
What is a realistic negotiated price to get either a Hybrid RAV4 Cruiser model or the GXL model, drive away?I am thinking 48k / 43k for the AWD models and 44k / 41k for the 2WD models respectively?
I've placed a order for a gx hybrid with full size spare for $38200 with floor mats...So that's roughly 10% off.. Which should be your target.. I had to go through a few dealers to get that price..
Just had my first look at one of these today. Not in any hurry to buy prob still 6 months off.But I asked the dealer what the current wait time is for hybrids as I've been told it is quite long ��� he said he has 15 coming in next month and 11 have been sold, so I could have one I that time frame if I wanted.
ssdddstr writes...Most km will be on the freeway, so I am wondering if the hybrid is worth it.You'll probably save 2L/100km for mostly highway driving so it might take a few years to get the extra cost back in savings. Having said that, you can use 91 petrol and still get in the low 5s (no benefit in fuel savings from higher RONS).I'd definitely still go for the hybrid if I was in your shoes as the extra power in the hybrid makes it a far nicer drive for overtaking! Extra power and better fuel economy for only $3k more is a win win in my book!
Snipyro writes...no benefit in fuel savings from higher RONS).Disagree, I found 95 gives slightly better fuel economy which offsets the increased cost compared to 91.
Snipyro writes...you can use 91 petrol and still get in the low 5s (no benefit in fuel savings from higher RONS).Thank you for the advice.

Brian McGee writes...Disagree, I found 95 gives slightly better fuel economy which offsets the increased cost compared to 91.Hmm, that���s strange. For me and others in a RAV4 group we found the difference to be small enough as to be inconsequential. It did not come close to covering the increased cost of 95RON. YMMV though.Also depends on your living area, I suppose. Where I am, 95 RON is usually 10-15% (usually 15-20c) more expensive, and no amount of optimisation for fuel would cover that increase in cost.Having said that, I did a 120km trip today with 91RON and got a 5.1L/100km so I���m happy anyway. Absolutely loving that a car this size can get this kind of figure!
ssdddstr writes...I think I would only consider the hybrid if I can get 5 or high 4s.

It���s significantly quicker to accelerate so that���s another benefit as well.If that doesn���t matter to you and you���re keeping the car till it���s dead, then perhaps petrol would suit your circumstances.

RAV4 GX hybrid 2020 DNCR cruise control questionComing to terms with my radar cruise control in my new RAV4.I have a problem.I am using cruise control at a lowish speed (say to go past a school).I speed up using the accelerator well past the cruise control speed set.Multi-information display of cruise control speed gets a white background.I can't seem to set the higher speed without turning the cruise control off and on.(I know I can manually increase the cruise control speed, but that takes attention away from my driving, often as I am merging onto a highway.)Is there something I am missing here?TIAJim
press the set button? like the initial button you press to set the speed limit.
Pressing Set only takes you back to the lower speed. It does not set the new speed as you would expect.
Just went for another drive. Pressing Cancel works, so I don't have to turn off cruise control completely.Anyone else with this model (Nov 2019) can confirm it is just not my own car that does this?TIA
WhirlJim writes...Pressing Set only takes you back to the lower speed. It does not set the new speed as you would expect.That sounds like you're pressing set while the cruise control is actually set. In that case it's going to drop the original set speed by 1km/h. If you're overriding the set speed (and hence the set speed shows as a white background, which indicates overspeeding) just simply cancel and set new speed.If you want to match the speed limit, as long as the RSA has identified the last speed sign, while the cruise is set, hold it up or down for a few moments and it will automatically match the posted speed limit.
most cruise control systems will "set" the new speed if your going faster than the original setting.eg..if i had cruise control set to 60km/h and i accelerated to 65km/h all you have to do is press SET again to set it to 65km/h.
PinzVidz: Cancel does indeed work.I guess my problem was that in my Toyota Aurion, braking OR significant acceleration would cancel the cruise control speed setting, and I was expecting the same behaviour from a more sophisticated system.

Is there a way to tell exact consumption for a trip?In our other car each time you start the car it shows the consumption since started.I can't find similar function in the Rav.
Yes, you need to adjust it via the steering wheel. It���s in the manual. Search for ���fuel economy���.

2WD vs AWD. I suppose its down to preference and what roads you travel on. Not sure its worth the 4k price difference for me.
That doesn't explain the difference between English speaking countries. No reason to have Australia, UK, USA and Canada with different names for colours and trim models.
jank writes...2WD vs AWD. I suppose its down to preference and what roads you travel on.Not sure its worth the 4k price difference for me.I'm thinking just 2wd as from what I've read, AWD only clicks in when it is needed, which is really only in snow, mud and occasionally rain. So if you stick to urban driving it will almost never activate.

Shadovv writes...which is really only in snow, mud and occasionally rain.Copy and quote from the manual:Automatically switches from front wheel drive to all-wheel drive (AWD) according to the driving con- ditions, helping to ensure reliable handling and stability.

Shadovv writes...I really wish we could get the two tone ones in Australia ��� the white with black roof option they get in the states looks pretty good with the black wheels.Funnily enough, I saw one last week on the road ��� white with the black roof (probably aftermarket wrap). Despite that I would have likely tended to agree with you before I saw that one, about benefits of playing on contrast, what I saw in reality I didn't like at all ��� it looked severely overloaded visually with black.  Mind you, the existing black trim where the roofrails are plus some other black elements already create enough contrast, together with the black wheels. Adding the black roof is definitely an overkill, in my opinion. I was considering getting the black roof wrapping done on my pearl Cruiser. Not anymore, after what I saw.

Last time I used the adaptive cruise in a traffic jam was in March, so my memory is a little hazy. It's able to follow the traffic speed and come to a complete stop. I think if it's a momentary stop it'll resume automatically, but if it's a longer stop, you have to press a button to start moving again.Is it kind of strange that I miss traffic jams? Particular the nightly heavy traffic going into the Burnley tunnel :\
Hi, guys. I'm new to this community and I found it really helpful.I need some help getting a GXL non hybrid model FWD and I was wondering what would be the reasonable price for that.

LusDekkar writes...Last time I used the adaptive cruise in a traffic jam was in March, so my memory is a little hazy.Make sure you actually have the adaptive cruise control on when relying on it automatically stopping.

If you are just cruising and maintaining speed it will just deliver enough power to the front wheels to do so. It's all about efficiency.The heads up info will show you when it's delivering electric or petrol power and to front or rear and I can tell you the rears do get used all the time in standard driving conditions. I really suggest going for a test drive if your dealers are open still, you can see it in action. It shows the power delivery of electric/petrol to front/rear and when battery is recharging etc.Accelerating to 50kph gently will be all 4 wheels, battery only, generally I find with maintaining speed with traffic my petrol motor will come on around 30kph, but it's being supplemented with the hybrid battery to both front and back (for fuel saving). When you get up to speed the motor will turn off again and just cruise on electric. Majority of driving I have done is in 50, 70 and 80kph zones. 0-30 = electric, 30 ��� 80 = petrol. Cruising at 50, 70 or 80 it goes back to electric only with just a bit of power to front wheels, accelerating a bit more the rears might get a bit, but slightly harder than that the petrol motor will kick in again (which only delivers power to front wheels).I don't think it would cruise on battery only at 100kph but I've not really done highway driving in it yet to confirm. If the majority of your driving is at those higher speeds you could possibly be better off just getting the non-hybrid 2L? Not really sure.I'm really happy with my GXL AWD :)

Hi all,Just wondering what people have been paying for the GXL petrol and hybrid models? Seen some posts mentioning 37K for the petrol 2WD and about 40K for the hybrid? Are these prices you can get or are they too difficult to achieve with dealers nowadays? if not what should i be aiming for when it comes to negotiate on price? Thanks in advance.
Shadovv writes...So basically asking all of the extras for free? I don't think you'd get that on such an in-demand vehicleIf the stock was in the right place, the demand has dropped and the salesman needs the deal, you may be lucky. Otherwise, you could get it without the tinting and sealing. More likely with the 2WD as there are apparently more around.
Best way is to call 5 or 6 or so dealerships with a price you're happy with, with a commitment of a deposit over the phone if they accept. If they all say no, then that's a good indicator your price is unreasonable.

Otherwise wait and look at end of month for a deal and see if there is a dealer looking to make up the numbers.
ssdddstr writes...Thinking about buying a new rav4 and need some advice regarding hybrid or petrol only.I currently drive a 2014 model rav4 to work. I do 110km per day and fuel economy tends to be 7.1/100km with 98 petrol.Most km will be on the freeway, so I am wondering if the hybrid is worth it.ThanksI do almost exactly half of that every day, on the freeway (with 100 speed limit). Cruiser Hybrid 2WD, set to ECO mode (green display)  and I use 95 petrol. I don't drive it on weekends (nobody does, I just drive different car). My figures are 5.7L/100km (it has around 7000 Km on the clock so far).So, your economy compared to now would be roughly (7.1-5.7)/100*110 = 1.54L per working day. Considering the price of 95/98 petrol is say around $1.30, it works out to be a couple of bucks per day.  You do all further math from your driving schedule.But once again, it's comparing Cruiser Hybrid with your current car. New RAV4 petrol only may be different by fuel economy from what you drive today.  Let's see if someone who drives petrol only RAV4 2019/20 replies ���  I remember ppl sharing their figures in this thread about a month or two ago...
Our priority was most powerful, given it's size and weight ��� HAWD (currently 5.6Lt/100). Was surprised how fast it accelerates when travelling at motorway speeds, up hills, with load (ski stuff), compared to our previous model GXL which used 11L/100km.

So does that mean that's it as far as a refresh for the next 12 months? I'll be ready to buy in the new year.To those who have ordered with a long wait, how much of a deposit did you have to pay? Wondering if I should order mine a couple of months early for January delivery if I can pay most of the balance then.
The way I see it.. You order now to get the car in November... Anything other than that order it in late November to get a 2020 build...I paid only $500 deposit.I can possibly a small or smiliar changes middle of next year... But nothing major
Something has always felt bad to me getting a November or December build car. 1-2months old and it's already a "year old" on paper.Might put an order in November and request a January plate one (fine if I get it in Feb)
Well manged to get an offer on July 2020 build Cruiser 2WD $46k, floor mats, tints and tank of petrol, after calling 6 dealers in NSW that's the best so far, most dealers would not go below $47k.So not the best deal looking at the google spreadsheet but most really good deals were pre or early COVID and posts from June in this thread is showing pricing closer to $45k this must be near limit of current discounts for a Cruiser FWD.  If I waited a month or so then I may save a $1-2k if a few demo's come up.
Shadovv writes...Something has always felt bad to me getting a November or December build car. 1-2months old and it's already a "year old" on paper.Most knowledgeable buyers on the second hand market care about model year, not build year.

Some manufacturers have tried releasing hybrids to compete against the RAV4 but they've been flops. E.g. the Subaru Forrester.
Brian McGee writes...E.g. the Subaru Forrester.Under powered engine mated to a very small electric engine not well thought through.
If it's one thing Toyota can do well, it's hybrid cars. Don't think any other manufacturer in the world comes close in terms of reliability and execution.
Lexus only hybrids are even better. Their 3.5L v6 RWD hybrids on the lc500h, ls500h and Gs450h have both performance and economy.

Brian McGee writes...If it's one thing Toyota can do well, it's hybrid cars. Don't think any other manufacturer in the world comes close in terms of reliability and execution.They certainly have early adopter advantage but as we've seen with the Koreans and EV technology carmakers like Tesla don't have a technological advantage for long. In that respect it will be interesting to see how Nissan's approach with the Ariya pans out. Shades of the well worn diesel electric locomotive by all accounts except they're swapping a diesel for an Atkinson cycle petrol engine since electric drive has plenty of torque.
Rendog writes...Honda CRV hybrid will give it a crackNot the current CR-V though. The current hybrid CR-V sold overseas has its battery pack located in the boot which caused it to lose boot space as well as the spare tyre akin to the hybrid Subaru Outlander.

Plus it���d ease the stock constraints and provide a competitive environment (read pricing) that isn���t just dominated by Toyota unless the market (Honda, Mazda and Toyota) decides to reposition itself higher as shown by the double price rise of RAV4 and CHR in light of where the Yaris is. Corolla will be next in line for a reposition.
Can you delete the Sat Nav from the GLX Hybrid AWD?
I find that when I am coasting along on a flat road in the hybrid the needle drops from the economy zone to the very top of the "charge" zone on the dash (ie. its about 1mm from the top of the charge zone). But when I apply the brakes it drops to the middle of the "charge" zone. I would have thought more charging would be happening when the needle is at the top of the "charge" zone so why does the needle drop lower in the charge zone upon regenerative braking? I know this is a minor issue but I am trying to keep fuel economy <5L/100km
I'm not actually sure if the gauge means anything, e.g. what the difference is from top and middle of 'Charging'. Not sure how you can continuously get <5L/100km unless your trip is mostly downhill and you drive on a warm day.
having more hybrids out there hopefully removes the stigma and resistance to the change. Plus it���d ease the stock constraints and provide a competitive environmentCompletely agree ��� more competition means we all get our Rav4s cheaper and/or with less of the issues (eg. reverse camera screen that is useless 50% of the time). I think Honda stuffed up by not bringing the hybrid CRV to AU. Even if they took 10% of toyota rav 4 hybrid sales they would have been selling approx 200-400 hybrids per month over the past 6 months (important sales for a company rumoured to be struggling). If they bring it out now they will be competing with the Ford Escape hybrid (due out next month) and tuscon next year which I think will be very popular. The forester hybrid needs a serious rethink urgently.
I'm not actually sure if the gauge means anythingyes I am probably overthinking it :) I get a bit bored driving sometimes... alternatively I could be thinking about it wrong ��� the lower you go in the "ECO" or "PWR" zones the less fuel you use... so maybe the same is true in the "CHG" zone (I know you are not using fuel in the "CHG" zone but the same principle ��� the lower in the zone the more efficient you are?)Its a novelty at the moment to stay <5L/100km (currently where I live its perfect temperatures ��� so no need for AC or heating) so I am stuck on 5L/100km (only done 1000km so far though). I am sure I will revert to the 5-6L/100km in summer ��� still amazing efficiency for the weight of the car!
WeRpLe writes...think Honda stuffed up by not bringing the hybrid CRV to AU.Yeah thats interesting.. I was tossing up getting a Honda CRV or a Rav4.  I eventually went with the Rav 4 purely because it was a hybrid.  So it may have been swayed to the Honda camp if they had a Hybrid for me to consider.I get the impression that Honda just aren't interested in the Australian Market anymore.  There were rumours that they were looking to exit completely.. one of the dealers confirmed that whilst they aren't existing completely they are moving towards where they no longer have exclusive showrooms anymore..  Its a shame.. I would have thought that they still had a lot of potential in the AUS market and am somewhat confused but this approach..

No point dreaming economics doesn't matter and why we're seeing the withdrawal of models along with the global rationalisations and partnerships. The moral to the story is- So many consumer eggsperts so few profitable long term suppliers ;)

I think they thought it was like a Tesla despite me telling them it was closer to the current hybrids just with a bigger battery.Toyota Australia didn't believe that anyone would want one here back in December 2019.  Maybe that has changed since they sold more Rav4 hybrids than their nearest competitor sold across all vehicles last month.  Maybe that has just confirmed what they originally thought.https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/fastest-ever-rav4-wont-make-it-to-australia-as-toyota-pulls-plug-on-plug-in-hybrids-77333
Thats a shame. Is more like an Outlander PHEV.I'd be able  to go to work and back on battery alone and charge it at night. I have solar and havnt had an electricity bill since 2010.

Does anyone have a Blackvue PowerMagic Pro installed with a hybrid? What minimum voltage is set?
Brian McGee writes...Does anyone have a Blackvue PowerMagic Pro installed with a hybrid? What minimum voltage is set?I did & gave up on it. Set at 12v or 12.5v it was running down the 12v battery in the boot. Car would still start, but there was not enough voltage to use the parking mode with the limited driving I was doing.I switched to the Blackvue B124 battery instead that I got a good deal on and now am using that hardwired.

The system is linked to Toyota���s SAP system which is then (I���m guessing) linked to their production   system.I assume the Japanese factories don���t work after normal business hours so probably best to check for updates between 9-6pm local Japan time.Once it���s scheduled for production then it���s only a matter of days before it gets physically built. Then the wait to get it shipped to Australia is another phase of the game.

Pindari12 writes...Does anyone know if it���s possible to turn off the adaptive cruise control over speed audible alarm?I turned if off in Navigation and does not come on during cruise control or regular driving, only chime I get is when you go outside the 'lane', you can still see on the dash if you go beyond the speed limit at any point but no noise.I think it's home -> settings -> navigation menu -> detailed nav settings -> speed limit set to "no''
Brian McGee writes...I suggest googling and seeing how people have fixed rattling noises with cars near the seatbelt area. It might give you suggestions on things you can tighten, eg roof racks etc.You can try using some sticky tape to temporarily hold it tight, to see if that eliminates the noise.Sticky tape didnt work as I tried a few times. My wift recorded the noise from the back seat and the youtube link is here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_nOByhzRcoDo you have any clue what causes this? Thanks.
Anyone tow with an AWD hybrid? I have a 950kg boat but not sure the the RAV4 is up to the job (I understand that it can theoretically tow 1,500 kg).
Koomerang writes...Anyone tow with an AWD hybrid?I bought the AWD so I could tow on the occasion as I���ve got access to a dual axle trailer for tip runs & the like. Only towed once since I got the Cruise and it did the job just fine. Towed probably about 1000kg in one tip run (concrete & rubble). Fuel usage went up but towed just fine. Not as powerful as the 6cyl Subaru Liberty wagon I had before, but for what I require, the RAV is fine for me.

HelloJust wanted to see what prices people were achieving currently on rav4 Hybrid AWD in a metallic paint in VictoriaI���ve looked at the spreadsheet and it seems most of the deals were prior the price riseAppreciate your help
Hi there. Looking at buying the cruiser AWD, but have a question about the cruise control. When you increase/decrease the set speed, are you able to do it in increments of 1km/hr at a time?Some brands only let you adjust by 2 or 5 km/hr which is annoying
sossy writes...When you increase/decrease the set speed, are you able to do it in increments of 1km/hr at a time?Yes. 1km/hr at a time is possible.
Yes, as Gregsi says, 1km/hr is the default. On my Cruiser the speed overreads by about 5% when checked against GPS so to travel at real 60 it needs to be set to 63.
sossy writes...When you increase/decrease the set speed, are you able to do it in increments of 1km/hr at a time?Like others have said 1km/hr is the single press of the plus/minus for cruise control. If you hold the plus/minus, it goes up or down in 5km/hr increments. If you have Road Sign Assist turned on, the hold will go to the recognised speed.
Hi all. Just ordered a Hybrid AWD Cruiser in Atomic Rush with Nutmeg interior and towkit. Came to $48650 D/A, expected delivery Nov 30th.

I have a new RAV4 GX Hybrid 2020. What octane petrol should I use?
91 minimumI use 95 as the increase in fuel efficiency offsets a fair bit of the increase in price.
Thanks, Brian. Excuse my ignorance, but if you use the higher octane, does that mean you get more oomph when you put your foot down?
WhirlJim writes...Thanks, Brian. Excuse my ignorance, but if you use the higher octane, does that mean you get more oomph when you put your foot down?The engine is designed around 91 so you won't get any benefit out of 95 or 98 beyond a small increase in mileage due to the higher density of those grades.
Gregsi writes...The engine is designed around 91 so you won't get any benefit out of 95 or 98 beyond a small increase in mileage due to the higher density of those grades.To be more specific, we're talking ~5% increase in distance here vs the 8-12c or ~10%(95) and ~20c or ~20% in $(98) uplift to select the more premium fuel hence you won't offset vs the cost, not even if your car is tuned to take the higher RONthe 4c you save on the E10 is also a false economy as the energy you lose in the fuel is greater than the 2-3% savings you make
Gregsi writes...so you won't get any benefit out of 95 or 98 beyond a small increase in mileage due to the higher density of those grades.Density of what?Octane rating is to do with resistance to detonation under high load/temperature conditions, not energy density ��� unlike adding ethanol to petrol.Anyway, an old argument, so I won't go there any further.The current RAV4 looks good though, totally different when compared to the 1994 original.

Mate, so was it a lemon you got or are there serious QC issues with the latest RAV4. I've been torn between this or the  CX 5 but then with the CX 5, I'm reading a lot of paint and rust issues.I was referring to this post, /thread/3q6qm219?p=291#r5814
Pavlov writes...Density of what?Octane rating is to do with resistance to detonation under high load/temperature conditions, not energy density ��� unlike adding ethanol to petrol.The density of the fuel.  Mass per Volume.  Higher octane components in fuel have a higher density as the molecules pack closer together due to their shape.  With E10, the ethanol has a lower density than the base fuel which is why the fuel economy is lower.Yes. Octane is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self ignition when compressed in the cylinder.  RON is actually the octane measured without load.  MON (Motor Octane Number) is an equivalent measure with the engine under load.At no point did I state that Octane is related to the energy content of the fuel.  It isn't. By definition iso-octane has 100 RON and n-heptane has 0 RON.  Everything is measured relative to these components.I'm a chemical engineer who has worked in oil refineries for 18 years.  I'm pretty comfortable with the concepts.
yeah you tell'em gregsi
Brian McGee writes...91 minimumI use 95 as the increase in fuel efficiency offsets a fair bit of the increase in price.First tank from the dealer was RON 91 and on the second tank I'm using is RON98.Fuel consumption (early days) 6.2 on RON91 and 6.0 on RON98 based on that it's not going to change your mileage much unless your doing a long highway trip. BTW my other half is liberal on the peddle so your litres per 100kms might be allot better than mine :)

SmellyTofu writes...Maybe off topic but kinda helps ���justify my 98 purchase��� on my car, but where does the sulphur come from? My understanding is the base fuels imported from SG is low sulphur but somehow Aussie fuels have at least >30ppm. Is it that the mix of Australian sources oil is the cause of it?Sulphur is present in crude oil.  Some have a lot, some don't have much.  To meet our fuel specs (particularly diesel) you need to have equipment to remove it.  We used to be near the front in terms of specs but have fallen way behind.  The Australian refineries date back to the 1950s/1960s and while they have been upgraded regularly their owners have invested just enough to meet our local fuel specifications.  When the specs were introduced it was thought that new vehicles would required 95/98 RON fuel (that's what the car manufacturers were saying). So the sulphur of 91 RON was left at 150 ppm as it was thought that it would die out over time.  Once the industry was on 95/98 at 500 ppm then the specs would drop to 10 ppm at some point in the future.  That obviously hasn't happened.Many refineries in Asia are newer and many are built for export so have invested to meet international fuel specs.  We mostly import from the Asian region.  So imported fuel will generally have lower sulphur than locally made.  There is some talk about moving to 10ppm on petrol again but its going to require several hundred millions dollars of investement (more sulphur removal) across the local refineries to achieve it.NSW has no local refineries any more and is generally supplied with imports so you may find that the imported fuel could be as low as 10 ppm across all grades.  I can't say that for sure but I've seen Certificates of Quality for imports with very low sulphur levels as the refineries don't generally change their setup for the small quantities coming to Australia.

Brian McGee writes...In percentage terms you are correct, but in dollar terms, for me it's about an extra $60 a year (even before accounting for the increased fuel mileage) which is peanuts.My post was not intended to rebut or take any side on any side of the decision for anyone to use higher RON than manufacturer specified levels. It was only intended to give quantitative information relating to the claim that you could offset a "significant" amount of the cost with the "increased mileage". By putting numbers to the claims, others are able to make a decision relating to the terms used which are otherwise vague.You have made the decision based upon your own usage and whilst I think we can all agree that $60/year additional cost to use a higher grade of fuel is small, others may not have the same sort of usage and may expect that a 10% increase in price would equate to a similar increased distance covered, by volume; closer to 10% than say 5%. This is particularly a sticking point for myself because the delta between 98 and 91 RON is almost constant at 20c, but the price of 91 has dropped significantly, so the jump to 98 RON is a significantly greater cost, as a %.In a similar topic of discussion, using E10 for a constant 3cpl discount would only make sense (in my opinion) once the price of fuel drops below 90cpl so that as a %, you aren't losing mileage without a corresponding discount of a similar amountUsing higher RON fuels has many benefits such as reducing harmful emissions, potentially keeping sensors and equipment cleaner for longer and if the car is tuned for it, will see greater than above figures claimed if the ignition is retarded to increase power output. I am unsure if the RAV4 software allows for this functionality and to what extent, and how much it ultimately affects the purported travel distance of the vehicle.
redmarine writes...Using higher RON fuels has many benefits such as reducing harmful emissions, potentially keeping sensors and equipment cleaner for longer and if the car is tuned for it, will see greater than above figures claimed if the ignition is retarded to increase power output.The cleaning benefits in premium fuels aren't due to the Octane or the base fuel.  Each brand has their own additive packs that are added to the fuel before it leaves the terminals.  The will contain detergents, friction modifiers, etc.  The premium fuels have a maximum sulphur specification but depending where it is produced there may be very little difference between 91 and 95/98.  Imported fuel could be as low as 10 ppm.  Locally made fuel will have higher levels.

I've had my Cruiser Hybrid for more than 6 months and have been experimenting with 91 / 95 / 98 petrol.  I do see a difference between 91 & 95, but not so much between 95 & 98.  It's true that the cost difference does not justify the fuel economy, but since it's better for the engine and I plan to keep the car for a while, I'm willing to pay a little premium for 95.If cost is your main concern, the way you drive probably plays the biggest part in the fuel economy anyway, amongst other things such as the use of air conditioning.

Imported fuel could be as low as 10 ppm.  Locally made fuel will have higher levels.apologies, i can see how it would seem to suggest that the higher RON fuels would infer that benefit but yes I do understand that the additives are entirely separate and could be added to the lower grade fuels with same effect. I was ambiguous with my statement, as they are currently marketed these would be the benefits. I am unsure if you included the same additives to lower RON fuels whether they would also increase to a similar c/L level anyway. It is irritating to say the least that the marketing has inferred that higher RON is better due to the additional benefits marketedAlso thanks for highlighting that there could be similar levels of sulphur in lower grade fuels, but it might be a case of buying "home brand" where you don't expect the lower sulphur levels but it's a nice "bonus" when it happens, vs being guaranteed each time you buy the branded product which comes with the guarantees. I think the facilities in Victoria will stay running for a long time yet so these "value" fuels would be impossible to come by for Victorians in the near future :D
It's cheaper buying 98 for the additives than a bottle of injector cleaner for every tank. In my use case, I don't fill up all that often. Tank could be in my RAV for 1-1.5 months coz the range is so good and that I don't drive all that much.

redmarine writes...I am unsure if you included the same additives to lower RON fuels whether they would also increase to a similar c/L level anyway.I don't know the cost of the additives but they will be trivial in comparison to the base fuel value + tax etc.  While the higher RON grades do contain more valuable components the price difference is mostly retail margin as all the focus is on 91 RON from a media and ACCC perspective.  Its like the difference in price between mince meat and fillet steak.  Both come from a cow but iti s the market that determines the price/value.I think the facilities in Victoria will stay running for a long time yet so these "value" fuels would be impossible to come by for Victorians in the near future :DI worked at one of those Victorian facilities for eight years.  COVID-19 is causing a lot of issues for all of the refineries.  Viva Energy has said that they are reviewing if they continue to operate Geelong long term.  There's going to be a lot of excess capacity worldwide and that is going to prevent them from making a profit for sometime.  Right now Viva has part of their site shutdown so will be importing something ��� either fuel components or finished fuel.

Those components include Toluene, Xylene and other aromatic molecules.  The lower octane components that are left out are generally straight chain or slightly branched hydrocarbons.  The aromatic molecules just take up less space for the same mass so have a higher density.

Are there still long wait times on the hybrid cruiser? Autopia a novated lease company are still saying 3-4 months wait.
About two months tops. Ring around and see who have them in stock.
Thank you Brian.Is there a newer 2020 model in Australia now, or I should continue looking at 2019? Toyota AU website still appears to be 2019, though I may be wrong
Yes, if you get a RAV built to order it���ll definitely be the 2020 model year.

Ive used 98 every 5000 km (so 3 tomes now). But ive honestly not found a difference, one of the tanks i averaged 4.8l/100 but the others were at 5. When i run 91 i average 5 to 5.1.

Hey guys been giving this a bit of a read and have a few questions.Is there much of a wait for GX hybrids at the moment? I believe I seen that it was 2 months?Do current models have Android Auto integration as default or is it being offered as an upgrade?Has anyone used this with 2 rear facing and 1 forward facing car seats? Having a look online shows that it should be possible but it's not a very common seat configuration so is a bit hard to make sure.
Penthus writes...Do current models have Android Auto integration as default or is it being offered as an upgrade?AA and Apple CP are installed by default now. Can���t answer your other questions sorry.
pitadotcom writes...Was really hoping to get a lithium one.I actually wanted the nickel battery, only because they are proven to be long-lived and reliable. The jury will be out on the Lithium versions for about 12 years, which is the average lifespan of the nickel ones.
That���s a great point. I never thought of it like that. I was just looking at the weight improvement. Being in Australia we do need that extreme durability.

The 12V battery is charged by a DC-DC buck converter from the HV battery.

Besides, the AGM version would be much less than $342 wholesale anyway. That is after all only the retail price from Supercheap Auto.I suppose nobody cares about these things until something goes wrong though. Myself, I'm gonna change it out for an AGM as soon as I receive delivery.

Tyrial7 writes...Certainly the megajoules of energy stored in highly volatile liquid form in the back of all ICE vehicles is a significantly greater issue.Given that the same family of lead acid battery have been used in all Hybrid (and some petrol) Toyota vehicles globally since 2015, maybe the risk is fairly low.

Still I'm just not a fan of sharing a cabin with an unvented hydrogen generator. If it was outside the cabin, fair enough, but it's not. Call it cheap peace of mind (or paranoia), when I've just spent over $48k on a vehicle, an extra coupla hundred bucks won't break the bank for me. Horses for courses, YMMV etc etc
Tyrial7 writes...Still I'm just not a fan of sharing a cabin with an unvented hydrogen generator. If it was outside the cabin, fair enough, but it's not.Completely understandable position to have I would think. At the end of the day I believe that the 12v battery in the RAV4 complies with regulations and its up to us as individual owners and our risk appetite on whether we replace the 12v battery or not.I personally am on the fence and might consider replacing the battery in the future. Not too fussed about it since it does not cost that much as you said.

Not too fussed about it since it does not cost that much as you said.Just remember, you may be able to use that battery in another vehicle in the future as long as you keep it charged, so it may be nearly cost neutral in the long run.

ThaBoss writes...I cant recall the last time I read a report about all combustion cars turning into small bombs whens they get into prangs.Never said anything about 'all combustion cars', but certainly whenever a vehicle fire does occur, which is a not insignificant risk in a crash, when is it anything other than the fuel system being the source of flammability? It's not as though we don't have a long and well known history of cars being known fire risks in collisions.

Anyone get a decent bike rack for their new RAV4?I am looking at options. I do not have a tow bar, so that kinda rules that you, so I could get a roof rack or a hanging rack, which looks a little flimsy.
703 writes...That is Toyota Australia trying to save $400 on AGM battery.Well funny you should say that because my interest was aroused by what the BIL found having a squiz under the bonnet of a mate's new 3000km Toyota. Sis is thinking about a new car so he was interested in looking at the engine and yowzah! The battery and receptacle were covered in battery acid with a top up battery. So they took a pic and cleaned it up and the upshot was when it went back to the Toyota dealer the story was-Oops! Sorry it was the wrong battery and they'd replaced it.Huh! As far as we're aware cars come from the factory with batteries and they're not all maintenance free. Hitachi flooded top up batteries in my son's MN Triton and same in my Challenger and their 2016 CX9 TC  Azami ceratinly had a flooded top up in it before recently being replaced by RAA. Now one thing these latest ECU controlled alternators can do is charge up to 15.6V to prevent stratification with calcium MF batteries and perhaps AGM too? I saw that on the BIL's SV6 Black wagon with a tired battery when the VE's had trouble doing that with replacements. Was that what boiled that Toyota flooded battery and they've had to replace them?

livehd writes...Anyone have any post-purchase qualms with the Rav4? What do you think Toyota could improve on?- Interior Lights are not LED and the window switches are not Illuminated. Easily fixed with aftermarket parts, but given the fact that even older Toyota cars have Illuminated window switches it feels like cost cutting. - No electric front passenger seat. Huge letdown given most other in this class will have an electrically adjustable front passenger seat in the top trim. - Boot space while spacious is pretty basic. No hooks, no latch to  collapse the rear passenger seats, etc. - No option for panoramic sun/moon roof if you want a Hybrid. - Missing convenience features such as heated steering wheel, ventilated front seats (again, not available if you want a Hybrid), kick to open tailgate, etc. Would have been nice if they have an add-on pack for these sort of things at the least.
We went with HGXL (2.5 AWD) as it was available quicker and within our savings budget and liked the silver wheels with saturn blue car. My only criticism was the downgrade from our previous GXL ��� in hard plastics. However, I've fitted some carbon fibre overlays and a  RAV4 rear bumper/tail protector (stainless steel). Also upgrading the interior dome light and reversing lights (leds). Very happy with the car & servicing costs (wifes third RAV). If the Cruiser's extra options appeal to you get that model (but they didn't to us).

That and the capped price servicing is the cheapest of the lot.
Thank you for the breakdown of features b/w cruiser > gxlA few things I could live without but they certainly stack it with pretty good value for money. I'll just say it's a personal choice to try avoid purchasing leather where possible.
livehd writes...Are there other vehicles that manage to tick all these boxes?

VW Tiguan ticks all the boxes but it's easily 10k more than the RAV4 and does not have a hybrid option. Servicing for the first 5 years also cumulatively costs at least 2k more than the RAV4.If you want something that has it all and a hybrid you'll probably be looking at a Lexus NX, Lexus RX or Volvo XC-60 which will probably cost double the price of the RAV4
VW Tiguan you could get a AWD Comfortline with luxury and drivers assist pack for around the price of the RAV4 cruiser. Still miss out on the hybrid though

You'd also need to add the sound and vision package to the Comfortline to get the panoramic view monitor which makes the Comfortline 5k more expensive than the RAV4 Cruiser hybrid AWD.

Hi PAT303,I���ve had the Rav4 Crusier Hybrid since 6 march 2020. Just filled up with 12911km on the clock. Total litres used since purchase has been 683. So 5.29l/100km. The worst tank was the 1st at 6.3l and my best has been 4.95l. Mainly driving in up to 80kph zones with highway drive about once a week. I use Eco mode around town & Normal on highway.

Thanks Gazza, as a reference our Sport returns 5.4ltres mixed 80-100km/hr rural driving, I'd be interested to know what figures the RAV would return on 91RON.
Maybe you don't hang around for a RAV4 because everybody's getting one-https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/all-new-hyundai-tucson-2021-high-tech-hybrid-revealed-to-rattle-the-toyota-rav4-and-mazdaSo long China as you can have the cheap marketplace ;)

Would have seriously considered getting the Tucson if the hybrid version is available here and I have not bought the RAV4 already.

I have a 35km commute to work of which approx 15km is 110km/h, 10km 80km/h and 10km mix of 50/60 km/h.Given that a lot is straight consistent highway driving, does this mean I wouldn't be one to gain much from the hybrid as far as fuel economy?

rjjs writes...Maybe you don't hang around for a RAV4 because everybody's getting one-Warning ��� long technological rant incoming:I've been a member of the Toyota hybrid fan club ever since I bought my Prius 10 years ago. My interest stems from my profession ��� electrical engineering.The Toyota hybrid system debuted in the 1st gen Prius in 1997 ��� 23 years ago. The system remains unchanged in concept to this day. Bigger motors, batteries, different packaging, yes, but the original mechanism of operation has remained unchanged.To this day, no other system comes close to the combination of low cost/real world fuel economy/extreme longevity/robustness that Toyota have accomplished.The Rosetta Stone that Toyota developed was the Power Split Device. This is the center of the transaxle arrangement that is able to manage the power interactions of the two Motor/Generators, the ICE, the battery and the hybrid system controller. It's kind of like a planetary gearset inside of another planetary gearset, a bunch of constantly meshed gears sitting in an oil bath, no friction materials, no engagement and disengagement of gears, no axial or perpendicular movement. Here is an informative (but slightly boring) video of how it functions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLNDGUISTYMThe end result of this is a system that, besides the battery and ICE, never wears out. Like, ever. There's nothing to wear out. Legions of Camry and Prius taxis with 600,000km+ are testament to this, as well as my own 315,000km Prius which drives as the day I bought it. (Putting aside the 1st gen Prius from 1997-2003 which had undersized motors that burnt out around 400,000km).Why the rant you ask? Well, other manufacturers don't have access to the PSD unless they license it from Toyota. That's expensive. So they develop lame systems like this:https://www.caradvice.com.au/836054/2020-subaru-forester-hybrid-2-0e-s-review/and this:https://www.caradvice.com.au/869255/2020-mazda-3-x20-astina-skyactiv-x-m-hybrid-review/I fear the Hyundai/Kia system is more of the same. I know they use conventional 6&8 speed autos for power transmission (DCT's for the PHEV's). They won't last nearly as long, they'll be more problematic over their (shorter) lifespan and they will probably have inferior real world economy.If you're the type that buys new, dealer services and gives it the flick at year 6 of the 7 year warranty (channelling you here rjjs) you'll probably be fine I guess, minus the inferior fuel consumption. As a longer term prospect, why not get the cr��me de la cr��me of hybrid systems, proven more than 15 million times over 23 years. Do it once, do it right I say.(No offence to Hyundai/Kia lovers, they're generally fine cars otherwise)

Nah I'm definitely picking up a new toy, fuel consumption is just a secondary thought when choosing engine.
Shadovv writes...Compared to non hybrid. My understanding is that hybrids don't benefit any lower fuel consumption if you are sitting on 110km going down the highway, given they don't recharge.Toyota���s hybrid system is much more than just regen braking. The Atkinson cycle engine they use is much more efficient than a standard Otto cycle engine at all times. There are other aspects of the system that benefit fuel economy that I won���t go into, but you should expect around 6L/100km on the highway according to owners. For reference, my 10 year old 315,000km Prius gets about 4.3L/100km on the highway, 4L/100km in the city.That being said, a diesel SUV would also be very well suited to your application, probably comes down to features and looks as the deciding factor.
Shadovv writes...Compared to non hybrid. My understanding is that hybrids don't benefit any lower fuel consumption if you are sitting on 110km going down the highway, given they don't recharge.That���s what people who don���t understand hybrids will tell you. There is still Occasional electric assist at 110k, there are still downhills on a motor way, the eCVT is always at the most optimal ratio and the Atkinson cycle of the engine.My Lexus GS450h provides much better economy than the same Gs350. Both rated and real world. Both 3.5L v6.Also our Lexus Rx450h being a 2 tonne SUV gets better mileage than the Rx350 at high way speeds.
spartacus1098 writes...It prob also plays a factor with Lexus vehicles , if you want the hybrid top of the range then Lexus Is through that doorGood point, didn���t think of that. As an aside, I test drove the NX300h before buying the RAV- it was lame. Terrible ride, not any quieter, less space, and of course much more expensive. Didn���t understand why until I read its still based on the previous RAV4 which apparently kinda sucked.

RAV4 is new and probably has another 4-5 years of small improvements before being replaced.

I was about to buy a Rav4 before I saw the new Tucson coming out next year. I keep my cars for the long term and rav4 missing features that I like.

Based on THS, Toyota later developed a new single-row planetary gear configuration [6]'Who did Toyota license it from?Themselves, see this patent filed by Toyota in 1996 entitled 'Hybrid vehicle drive system having two motor/generator units and engine starting means':https://patents.google.com/patent/US5934395A/enIt is true that there were similar designs before this one, but Toyota figured out a method to start the ICE using one of the motor/generators, whereas previous designs did not. In addition, Toyota's system does away with several clutches and has lower mechanical losses. In the 24 years since filing, nobody has figured out a better system that doesn't infringe on the Toyota patents.Toyota has many other patents, such as the development of advanced IGBT's (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors) that improved the performance of their hybrid inverter to world's best at the time, but that's another topic.Miller cycle not Atkinson.While the Atkinson and Miller Cycles share the delayed closing of the intake valve, Toyota don't use a supercharger as required by the Miller Cycle, therefore it is standard Atkinson cycle:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cycle'As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_cycle'In the late 20th century, the term "Atkinson cycle" began to be used to describe a modified Otto-cycle engine���in which the intake valve is held open longer than normal, allowing a reverse flow of intake air into the intake manifold. This "simulated" Atkinson cycle is most notably used in the Toyota 1NZ-FXE engine from the early Prius.'There you go, you've learnt the difference between the two cycles today, you're welcome! I can explain the Otto cycle for you as well if you wish to learn.I never achieved those numbers with my Corolla hybrid.That's because your Corolla hybrid, if you really do have one, has a higher drag coefficient and larger frontal area than the economy focused Prius (0.25 vs 0.30-32):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficientNo need to apologise, you ain't bursting anyone's bubble...

Mucchan writes...Shouldn't these patents expire by now  though?Patents are funny and often complex things. There are related patents that expire from 2024-2036 that are integral to the improvements that Toyota have made over the years. Technically, a manufacturer could build a hybrid system identical to the 1997 Prius, but they wouldn't be able to incorporate most of the improvements since then, which would make them uncompetitive relative to Toyota's current models. This forces them to use a significantly different design, as Toyota have engaged in continuous improvement on that particular hybrid design.My first rant about the Power Split Device greatly simplified the current patent situation for brevity, it's much more complex than just that particular technology, even though it is a lynchpin of the design. For example, up until the 2016 Prius, the transaxle assembly was axially mounted on a single shaft, after that they split the Motor/Generators (and PSD) onto parallel shafts, allowing for a significantly more compact design. This is just one of many improvements they've made and patented, which prevent anybody else from using a PSD in that particular configuration.Basically, they're so far ahead on hybrid technology that other manufacturers will have to leapfrog them straight to EV's if they want to compete.
Tyrial7 writes...Basically, they're so far ahead on hybrid technology that other manufacturers will have to leapfrog them straight to EV's if they want to compete.Interesting read. Toyota definitely have an edge on hybrid given the effort they have spent on it. It's a shame that they might be playing catch-up on full EV since they're quite late to the party.
Mucchan writes...full EV since they're quite late to the partyI don't think so.. Full EV will be a very simple change... Its much less complex than the current engines which have to meet strict emission standards. I wouldn't be surprised if toyota is pretty much ready to go.. All they are waiting for is better batteries or way of charging them

InternalBleeding writes...I wouldn't be surprised if toyota is pretty much ready to go.. All they are waiting for is better batteries or way of charging themPersonally, I don't think they're waiting for anything, I reckon they're furiously working on better batteries as we speak. There's a book called 'The Prius that Shook the World' by Hideshi Itazaki (you can google the PDF, 7th link in the google result, Priuschat forum) and in it the author describes how they partnered with Panasonic to make the worlds most power dense, reliable and compact NiMH battery at the time, because nothing was commercially available that had the desired performance characteristics for the Prius.Of course, at the time, all the other manufacturers were asleep at the wheel regarding emissions and fuel economy, so Toyota had the field to themselves. Things are a little different now, emissions/fuel econ are everything and competition is fierce. Looking forward to see what they can do, but for the short to mid term future, hybrid is our transition technology, and nobody does them like Toyota.

Tyrial7 writes...Hi all. Just ordered a Hybrid AWD Cruiser in Atomic Rush with Nutmeg interior and towkit. Came to $48650 D/A, expected delivery Nov 30th. Bought from Cessnock Toyota, I said i wanted it for under $49000, and they came straight back with that price, no haggling back and forth.Thanks again for sharing the deal you got. I got a similar deal thanks to you.I had been in contact with brokering service called Georgie, but managed to get a better deal by speaking to a dealer directly. Originally, I put in an enquiry through the Auto Expert motoring news/reviews website run by John Cadogan, after seeing all of John's promises of "saving thousands off the price of a new car". After I filled out the online form, I was called by a broker from Georgie, who said I had been referred to them by Auto Expert.RRP for AWD Hybrid Cruiser with towbar and premium paint was circa $52,500. The best quote received back from the broker was $49,500, ($3k or 5.7% discount). I told the broker that their best quote was still higher than what I had expected and that I'd "seen people on forums get better deals recently".Upon hearing this, the car broker agent warned me that not everyone posting online is 100% honest, that some users like to big-note themselves and exaggerate the deals they got to look cool, and finally that some forum posters might be referring to prices before on-road costs...Anyway, using a Tyrial7's price as a guide, I was able to negotiate a similar price with a dealer directly, $48,500 including tow bar/ball/wiring and premium paint. $4k or 7.6% discount on a car that is basically sold out everywhere, pretty happy.Two things to note: Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts. Secondly, car brokers won't always be able to get you the best deal. I think that the prices through the broker are a bit higher because the dealer has to pay the broker a "finder's fee" for your business.
intrasonic writes...Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts.I agree. One broker I dealt with didn't believe the price I got (was almost borderlining on rude when I told them). Back in March when there was a 8 month wait, I got the RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid for $45.5k D/A. It pays to put in the hard yards and call several dealers.Brokers need to charge a commission/fee which means money in their pocket, not yours.
intrasonic writes...Thanks again for sharing the deal you got. I got a similar deal thanks to you.Fantastic, glad I could help!Originally, I put in an enquiry through the Auto Expert motoring news/reviews website run by John CadoganThat's so surreal, I did exactly the same thing and got a very similar price from Georgie, I probably should have mentioned that in my original post.Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts.Yep. There was one on the forecourt that matched my spec minus the nutmeg interior, I asked 'how much for that one?' He said 'I got it in yesterday and sold it today at RRP'. Don't expect to get a discount for floor stock at this point, but build to order is just cream for the dealer ��� think about it, there's no holding costs for them, it just goes into a queue, gets built, comes in and they give it to you minus their nominal profit. Then they get a chance at dealer servicing and repairs over the life of the car, especially if the customer got a good deal from them.Secondly, car brokers won't always be able to get you the best deal.Yep again.I was able to negotiate a similar price with a dealer directly, $48,500 including tow bar/ball/wiring and premium paint. $4k or 7.6% discount on a car that is basically sold out everywhere, pretty happy.Very nice, when is your estimated delivery date?

Thanks for your advice. The car I am after will be used 10 km per day during the week to schools and 30 km per day during the weekends. I hardly go for long drive.Do you recommend petrol only or hybrid?I read that if most of the drive is slow and short distances, the hybrid engine is not recommended as the faster and longer drive is important for the battery to be charged.
in my personal opinion i would stick with the hybrid...more poowwwwa..and better fuel economy..and i guess it will have better resale value etc.

Kilavan writes...I read that if most of the drive is slow and short distances, the hybrid engine is not recommended as the faster and longer drive is important for the battery to be charged.Nope, that's back to front. Slow and short distances are very good for hybrids, as the battery gets charged by regenerative braking as you slow down. This gives great fuel economy, the hybrid will probably use about 5-6L/100km in that type of driving, while the standard petrol will do about 9-10L/100km.That being said, with the very low km you will be doing, the standard petrol one would probably be fine.Source: have owned a Toyota hybrid for 10 years.

I presume you can only hear it when you're stopped in traffic or coasting at slow speeds and the engine is off? All A/C's make that noise (flowing refrigerant), but the engine sound and road noise generally masks it in normal cars at all times.

Kilavan writes...read that if most of the drive is slow and short distances, the hybrid engine is not recommended as the faster and longer drive is important for the battery to be charged.That���s not true.
lazydesi writes...$28-29Thanks. What would be the best final value then?
So frustrated after getting a call from our dealership advising that our Cruiser Hybrid will now be delayed for a December pickup (ordered in August). Apparently was told that Toyota was preparing for a December unveil of the hybrids. Surely new folding mirrors is nothing to brag about...
I'm in the same boat as you... Lol no pun intended haha
elma3str0 writes...Surely new folding mirrors is nothing to brag about...lol. True. Just ���installed��� my folding mirrors on mine this morning.
Kilavan writes...Thanks. What would be the best final value then?the kms are too many in 7 -8 months.do you really need that particular model?if yes, you could end up around 30k.For that price have a look at 1-2 years old Subaru Forester or skoda suv.
has anyone asked the dealer if you can get the jbl stereo added to their car package (say on the base gx or gxl model)? since the car has to be built anyway?
InternalBleeding writes...has anyone asked the dealer if you can get the jbl stereo added to their car package (say on the base gx or gxl model)? since the car has to be built anyway?Audio is not available as an accessory.if you like modifications, youtube have videos regarding audio upgrades.I have upgraded dash speakers to jbl club 3020.

That is the pickup date from the dealer.After the freighter has docked, it's usually up to 5 business days for transit to the dealership and another 5 for them to prep the car. Most dealerships want to get you the car ASAP so it is usually much sooner.
Awesome, only last week the dealer told me it wouldn't be here till late November. Had a feeling she was just trying to fob me off so I wouldn't be ringing her constantly checking up. Mind you, I ordered late March and that was the 1st time I have called since then.
I found the Toyota tracking website incredibly accurate. I think it���s linked to their SAP system in real time.

Hi everyone,I am up for the 12 months service on my Cruiser (bought October last year, complimentary was done in Nov 2019, and they fitted AA/ACP back then too).Anyone went through that service yet? Anything specific I need to know? The part reason I am asking is I've just booked it for next Thurs (with the same mob who did complimentary), and tried to request the Android Auto update to the latest revision, but was told that there were no AA updates since it was installed in November 2019. Is that right? How was yours serviced?Also, they advised that the set of navigation maps upgrade would be $300+ if I want it. On the top of the service cost. Are they trying to rip me off? Anyone received a free 2020 maps upgrade on your 12 months service?
Not sure if $300 is a fair price, but I found this from last year suggesting the cost is $180. Ring a few dealerships and ask.https://www.billrobertsontoyota.com.au/2019/03/25/update-sat-nav-maps-next-service/#:~:text=Updates%20should%20only%20be%20performed,new%20sim%20card%20%26%20fitting).I'd imagine Toyota would need to first need to update their firmware so it's compatable with the new AA version before they can offer it.
updated pricing and specs are uphttps://www.toyota.com.au/-/media/toyota/main-site/vehicle-hubs/rav4/files/rav4-spec-data-sep2020.pdfi was hoping the base model gx/gx hybrid would get the "full smart entry / smart start" like other manufacturers in that segment.and the gx isn't gettting the "Premium steering wheel and gear lever" like some car articles have mentioned either.
So you cannot get hud for rav4?  My corolla has a hud...
People here have mentioned turning off the school warning messages but does that also turn off the over-speed warnings?I have a Corolla and have the speed warnings on and wouldn't want to lose that (very handy in 50k zones when you accidentally creep up), but not the school warnings.When I test drove the Rav4 I got a school warning and I was nowhere near a school.

Maybe because GX is only getting the premium steering wheel but not the gear lever?
yeah you could be right..i do remember the dealer showing me the bulletin which i think only mentioned the premium steering wheel and possibly not the gear lever.still smart entry would be good..i really hate those electronic rear view mirrors (eg on the gxl..or other cars)..they are so annoying.

Question for those that have the nutmeg interior: How is the leather holding up? We're very close to ordering a Atomic Rush/Nutmeg however the wife is concerned the lighter colour will show dirt/scuff marks more easily.
Instant Human writes...Nutmegi for the life of me can't understand why people would want a light seat interior...everything shows up on it. any scuff..any dirt etc. and its got that look of a "old fart"
Light colour keeps the interior a LOT cooler in summer. Plus it can be a style choice, Black is pretty overdone in modern cars.
Hi, I am planning to buy a cruiser hybrid AWD either in black or electric blue. I am based in Sydney. Can some of you recommend a dealer that can give a good price. I am fine with anything around 48.5K. But dont want to pay more. Thanks guys
Engine writes...Light colour keeps the interior a LOT cooler in summer. Plus it can be a style choice, Black is pretty overdone in modern cars.It���s very much a personal preference but there are several things one can do to ensure their cars are cooler in summer, not just choosing a light coloured interior.I personally think Toyota botched the nutmeg option. It just doesn���t seem to marry up with the rest of the car���s interior colour imo.
hornsby toyota...during the weekdays speak to Matt Baltussen from fleet sales...(i can give you my name in private messages)...he was pretty good and gave a good price.other place that seems to get a good price is Ryde Toyota(both are from my personal experiences however i dont know what the waiting time is going be between the dealers)

Hi, anyone in Perth have advice on where to get good price on awd cruiser. Not getting near the `standard` 48.5k.. don't mind waiting.. and some discount of accessories would be good too. Cheers.
I can���t help you, but I can let you know why you���re struggling with prices. The official distributor of Toyota���s in WA is a seperate entity to Toyota Australia which distributes in the other states:https://www.goautonews.com.au/toyota-loses-a-star-performer/
LOL writes...When using lane keep assist mine always feels like it is too close to the left side of the lane.Yes I did notice this. And it first it freaked me out. I now trust it. I think the issue is that the radar puts the car right in the middle of the lane but when I drive I put the car off centre closer to the right hand side of the lane.
Cruiser AWD hybrid, just the front window tint and rubber mats so not as good as the others who have the other things thrown in. I talked to 4 dealers, most of them do not do anything below 50k
Now I have secured the car, I want to ask the next question. What color?Me and my daughter like the Eclectic blue, but my wife thought that was ugly and has bad resale value. She likes white or black(Of course, you can't go wrong with these two colors, but they are boring)I personally do not like silver sky, glacier white (too many white cars)So other colors are graphite, black, atomic rush and saturn blueTO be honest, all the other colors are very common for different car makers. the reason why I like the eclectic blue it is because of the toyota badge which is essentially the same color and it is kind of unique.I also found the below color description for corolla, I think it might help you choose.Eclectic BlueLet���s just say, you���re not shy��� You have happy and out there personality but you don���t take life too seriously! The colour blue reflects happiness and you truly believe that. You���re favourite thing to do is cruise up David Low Way with the windows down and the sea breeze blowing in your hair. Singing at the top of your lungs, you don���t care who sees you. With your free spirit personality, you would be most likely to upgrade to a Hybrid Corolla.Volcanic RedYou���re straight-up fire and a confident sass ball.  You���re happy to stand out and kinda enjoy the attention. And yes, you truly believe that your Corolla goes faster than everyone else���s because it���s red. Your mind is at ease knowing that the All-New Corolla is fitted with the latest Toyota Safety Sense features including Road Sign Assist that is designed to recognise Australian speed signs and alert it���s time change your speed. You love your new Corolla!Oxide BronzeYou���re an individual who dares to be different but is trendy and sophisticated at the same time. Your idea of a perfect day is jumping in the car and heading to Brisbane for a day of shopping and then dinner and drinks with friends. You���re the type of person who can���t wait to get a hold of the latest tech and thinks that the wireless charging feature in the Corolla ZR is the best thing EVER!!!Glacier WhiteIf you drive a white car, you're probably someone who values the simple things in life above all else.  You are motivated to achieve success but the meaning of success to you isn���t only a successful career, it is also having an easy and balanced life. Your phone is always connected to your Corolla���s Bluetooth, as you can���t live without your daily dose motivation and wisdom from your favourite lifestyle podcasts.Peacock BlueThis Corolla is dark and mysterious. You���re a night cruiser and enjoy heading up the Maleny range to check out the lights. You also can���t get enough of the ambient illumination inside your Corolla which makes you feel like rockstar. You���re not a huge fan of local Sunshine Coast radio��� Bluetooth and a cool playlist are more your thing!Eclipse BlackYou���re a sophisticated and seriously cool individual who likes the finer things in life. You only have to take one look at the sleek new exterior design of the Corolla and also the thoughtfully crafted interior and, you���re in love! The newly designed front seats hold firm, created to help minimise stress and heighten your overall comfort. Being the sophisticated person that you are, you���ve most likely opted for the ZR model as you have the choice of red or black leather accented seats.  Let���s just say, you like to be comfortable and look good at the same time.
Whatever you do, do not buy a car colour for resale. You are financially much better off getting a car that you love with an emotional connection so you will keep it longer.I���ve got a normal everyday car (Xtrail) I���ve had for years but in a colour I love (bright red). I would always like a new car and the colour has saved me thousands as if my current car was something sensible for resale  like white, silver or grey I probably would of traded it in a year ago maybe getting extra bored of it. The colour for me helps me keep interested in it.Everyone has different tastes, some would love a white car and get bored of a red car quicker. Trick is to think what you like now and what you like in a few years from now
Buy the colour which connects to you two the most. I got the graphite because in my eyes it was the most aesthetically pleasing of the bunch. It also matches the trims the best ��� and there's a lot of them on the RAV4.I wouldn't go white as it's far too common and screams 'Government fleet vehicle'.I wouldn't go black/navy because it's far too hard to keep it looking nice and because it'll get crazy hot in summer. Dark colours looks awesome as long as it's well polished. If it's dirty it looks very average.I liked the atomic rush but it's more maroon than red. If it was red I'd be all over it.The light blue looks okay but is very flashy, almost like a blue highlighter. It's a love/hate relationship I think.If you want you can get the car roof painted if none of the current combinations speaks to you. Also I'm sure it is easy painting the Toyota badge if you want it to match your colour.
Hi All,So I look to have secured an AWD Cruiser in Eclectic Blue. Someone���s finance has fallen through so I can get the vehicle by the end of this month.The dealer just called to say they have checked the stock list and the particular car I have a hold on has the nutmeg/beige interior. Does anyone have pictures or a link to what this combo looks like? I have searched a bit and can���t find it! I���m slightly concerned but really only decided yesterday to buy a new car so feel pretty lucky to have secured one so quickly.For the inevitable price question I got it for $50,900 with rubber interior mats, rubber boot mat, side steps, weathershields and tint. Not the best but not the worst!

My young 1 month old cruiser hybrid got hit by the first hail storm of the season, thankfully not too many on the roof/bonnet and rear right quarter panel and the repair looks flawless and only took 3 days. Good that half the car is bloody plastic and hail doesn't affect it and the technician loves Toyota's metal, good to work on.

cm. writes...has anyone managed to get a new or near new non-hybrid CVT GX for <$30k?Nah no chance sorry. RRP IS $38562 (NSW driveaway price, Glacier White). Not too much wriggle room on base models, easier to get big discounts on higher grades. You���ll be able to get down around $36k if you haggle hard then delete the satnav ($1k saving). Looking at Carsales.com, cheapest ones with 10���s of thousands of k���s are around $34k.

2 questions for my Hybrid AWD Cruiser1. What's the recommended tyre pressure for the 18 inch tyre? I asked Toyota service guy when I went in for 1 month inspection. He told me the tyre pressure is 40 psi (part of their routine check). I just think it's on the high side and want to double check, currently I keep it at 38 psi. Should I pump it up to 40 psi?2. What's the maximum size of SD card Toyota Dashcam can take? It came with 16Gb. I search online and couldn't find the answer. Hopefully someone here has done the testing to find it out.Thanks in advance.

Sri, floor mats are standard, side step and nudge bar, you can have for $48500 or less if you negotiate. Full tank is also standard. $51K is a no deal. Considering standard RRP is ~ 52K. I was offered $47700 for Rav4 cruiser awd with floor mats ( this is standard) cargo mats, front window tint and weathershield. I added side step for $48500. I asked everyone around and was told $48500 is currently a going price and not special. So you can definately do better.My trick was I sent enquiries to every one on the last day of the month and told them this is $47700 is my offer and if they are interested they can call me. The next day first day of the month, literally everyone called me. I was also quoted $47700 with a dash cam but no side step so i did not proceed with that deal.The base rrp before gst and other expenses kicks in or the rrp at which the dealer purchases the 2020 RAV4 ifrom Toyota directly is s $46415.

Of course with it set at the factory spec you have to be more observant in checking the pressure doesn't go too low. So if you don't mind the ride I'd leave it at 38 psi for better tyre wear, increased economy and piece of mind that the pressure should stay in the safe zone.

Set it at what the door panel says. The RAV4 already has skinny tires and because of that really bad stopping distances. You don���t want to reduce traction any further.

hi, whats the wait time peroid like right now on hybrid? need a car by December or January next year and i am thinking of buying new 2wd 2.5 cruiser hybrid (any info on best price will be appreciated) or 2019 Edge version if wait time is still over 3 months
Noticed recently that when RAV4 is parked with all doors locked, opening the rear motorised door using its rubber button (next to the number plate, facing down) also unlocks all other four doors. Imo, it is a serious flaw ��� if I am doing multiple trips in the shopping car park unloading the shopping trolleys and only open the boot, the other doors should remain locked until I spicifically open them. Even if there is an option of changing this behaviour via the menu, it still should be defaulted to "stay locked".I only accidentally found that they are unlocked, because you don't know what you don't know.Comments on that?
digital_silence writes...I only accidentally found that they are unlocked, because you don't know what you don't know.This maybe a dealer setting? Ours does the opposite, which is that if I have the doors lock and I press the boot button nothing will happen until I explicitly unlock the doors. (Honestly one of my frustrations with the RAV4 (and modern cars) is how opaque all the different door locking/unlock/beeping/etc options are and how to setup the car as you want. I don't understand why this can't be made so much easier for people to control).
MMC writes...I press the boot button nothing will happen until I explicitly unlock the doors.do you mean on the key? or the button on the boot? the one o n the boot is what they mean.Mine the same as both of yours. doesnt open with key fob unless car unlcoked.

Wazza77 writes...? or the button on the boot? the one o n the boot is what they mean.The button on the boot. I have to use the key *first* to unlock the car. It's bloody annoying as my other car will do the right behaviour (allow me to open the boot when I'm close and only unlock that "door").
digital_silence writes...Comments on that?Once upon a time you had to put the key in the boot lock to unlock and lock it. Same as the driver's door (or front passenger door) and then you'd have to reach around to all the other door buttons to unlock them if anyone wanted to access them. I guess every generation has their crosses to bear ;)

Do you have your key in your pocket at the time??My other car doesn't have the fancy unlock doors/boot with key in pocket, I have to press the button on the remote, but often I just pull the handle and then realise Oh yeah different car ;)
MMC writes...The button on the boot. I have to use the key *first* to unlock the car.Weird one? A press of the rubber button under the lip of the boot unlocks my boot straight from locked. There is also a little round button under there to lock and unlock if needed.
It���s funny it���s a criticism, as when we had a Camry my wife had the exact opposite frustration. As it was a keyless car but when you unlocked the boot no other doors unlocked.So you get to the car, hands full of shopping and kids, unlock the boot to put stuff initially in the boot ��� including your nappy bag or bulky handbag, get to the passenger doors and they are still locked, so have to go back to the boot ��� fish out the keys out of the bags and then get the kids in. The other option is to keep the bag on you whilst in a tight car park and wrangling kids into their seats.She asked me about dozen times was there a wayfor the entire car to unlock when you unlock the boot from behind
2 Engine:I think you are missing the point. But maybe I am. In a case of keyless entry such as with this RAV4 (I am not sure what your Camry does, but assume it would do the same), when the key is in proximity to the car, all doors remain locked until you actually touch any door handle. I can come close to the locked car and watch that light go on, but if I then leave the scene without touching any handles, the car doors remain locked, and that is the way it should be.In your example, when you put your stuff into the boot first, and then try to open the side doors, they should surely open no problems, as the key is nearby. So, they are "pre-unlocked" by the key proximity, but won't fully unlock until you touch the handle. I don't know why they didn't open in your description. They should have.My issue is that when I open and then close only the boot on the previously fully locked car, and I don't touch any side doors handles in the process and then walk away, so the key is no longer in proximity, still anyone can come to the car and open the side doors ��� they are unlocked, even though I have not touched any of them.Summary: opening and closing the boot without touching the side doors leaves them permanently unlocked even when the key is not in proximity, which I reckon is a serious flaw.
digital_silence writes...My issue is that when I open and then close only the boot on the previously fully locked car, and I don't touch any side doors handles in the process and then walk away,As Wazza stated a mechanism exists to lock the car.

You have to lock the boot of a SUV once closed, it won���t automatically lock like a sedan boot. When you lock the boot on the RAV4, it will lock everything else

Obviously my comprehension skills fail me but from what I understand, try doing the following to change the door opening sequence till you get the desired functionality.Good luck.Ensure the car is switched off.On the remote fob press the alarm key and lock key for 5 second simultaneously till you hear a beep. It should cycle through the different doors locking.Rinse and repeat.
razmataz writes...So my car is locked, I just open the boot and close it, my whole car is still lockedIn the case of Rav you are saying I now have to take the key out and hit lock again and it will not auto lock if i just close the boot?May have to get an owner in case Rav4 is different. But with proximity, you approach the boot and unlock it ��� this unlocks the whole car. When you close it, you need to press the rubber button on the boot and whole car locks.  So no extra buttons are pressed to lock the rest of the car ��� it���s just synced with the boot
according to the manual...there is 2 buttons on the rear boot door.button 1 unlocks the doors.button 2 locks all the doors. (its the smaller button)
Engine writes...But with proximity, you approach the boot and unlock it ��� this unlocks the whole carIn my current car (Kia Optima) only the boot opens with proximity if I stand or approach the boot.

Wow... It looks like I almost started a little boot hollywar.Another brilliant idea visited me today (I haven't opened the door to it, but it left me a written message :)The principal difference in door locking behaviour between sedan and SUV is that for the latter, if the boot is unlocked, you can get inside the salon and open any door you want from inside, whereas for the former, you can not get to the salon from inside the boot. (Maybe also for that reason, that boot door in SUVs is actually called a rear door, not a boot).So, obviously, if your SUV's rear door is unlocked, there is no point keeping the other four locked, as that would not provide any extra security to the car innards, so Toyota decided to unlock them too anyway for SUV. Sedan is a different story, and keeping its salon locked when the boot is unlocked, makes a perfect sense, as you can only open the boot from the salon, but not vice versa.
digital_silence writes...you can not get to the salon from inside the bootdon't most cars now have rear seats that fold down...so you can fold them down from the boot. (some cars even have the release lever in the boot)
I am yet to see the sedan car where the releaser latch tab for rear seat folding down is accessible from the boot.Not saying that there isn't one, but I personally haven't seen that.
one example..which I have access to is...a 2017 mazda3 sp25 sedan. in the boot you have 2 rear seat fold down levers.
InternalBleeding writes...don't most cars now have rear seats that fold down...so you can fold them down from the boot. (some cars even have the release lever in the boot)Lol, that is because the era of mainstream sedans is over. Its only SUV and crossovers now that have replaced the segment.Interestingly the Camry- more so the Hybrid- is the exception in that sales are stable.

Buyers of the RAV4 Hybrid... What other cars did you consider?I ask because I'm worried I'm a little too attached to the Rav4. It seems to have everything I would want.. decent size, good fuel economy, right tech, etc. But I might have blinkers on and some comparisons would help.

Can someone please tell me which way the light switch in the boot flicks in order to switch the light on? Mine flicks up.
Not that I use it too much, but is it just me or do people find the manual gears reversed?  In my RAV4 you push the gear stick forward to go to a higher gear (2-3-4 etc) and then back to you to go down In gears (4-3-2 etc).To me that seems counter intuitive.  Pretty sure in my Mazda CX-5 it was reserved which seemed more natural.

Also the fuel economy is not that great...but yes the nicest car.The CRV ..is a typical honda...its sort of all over the place with the interior and styling...and what I dont like about it..is your using a 1.5L turbo that's been tuned to something like 140kw pulling roughly a 1.6 tonne vehicle.To me the only thing that sucks on the RAV4 is the interior finish quality (could be more nicer for the base model) and the infotainment system.Like your self I was shopping around for a very long time before I decided on the Rav4......and I'm still waiting to get it to..haha
Still think Tiguan is the nicest in the segment, probably get a fully loaded Comfortline with luxury pack and drivers assist pack for under 50k. But not a hybrid and is due for a mid life update soonI���d still take a RAV4 over one

Does anyone know if its possible to turn off the chiming when the doors are open and if so how. Its annoying when I am sitting in the car in the carport trying to work out all the settings.I know I can turn the a/c on but some of these settings require you to be in accessories mode, or I could open the window but its pretty hot under the carport.
"well my car status has changed to""Planned production month:	November 2020""yay."
Anyone notice any wet patch on their roof liner, this issue was seen on the American sold vehicle made in both 2019 and 2020 . The cause was the plastic clips that holds the roof rails not having any sealant. (the black plastic bar that run the length of the roof on both sides)..Correction..Issue is not that the clips are without sealant but the foam o rings used are notkeeping water out properly.

Thanks for that. Talking about the OBD2 connector, I found out something else yesterday. I have 2 aftermarket HUD's (Repco and SCA) which have been working in previous cars and found neither would work in the Rav4. Did a bit of research and found quite a few HUD's aren't compatible with hybrid cars. Might have to try a GPS one.

The market is flooded with cheap copies. Some even sell them expensive to make them seem "original" You need to go to the website Dr Prius and the devs have done a lot of work to assess which ones are good and which ones work.

benjsc writes...Do you have a known source for OBD2 connectors that work with the RAV4 and drprius, looking around there is so many it's hard to know which one will actually work.IMHO best adapters around are the ODBLink ones. I have both an LX and an SX (and prior to this a cheap ebay BT one), and have worked with pretty much anything (including Lexus HSD which I guess is what you're after). I use the USB version for those increased read rates, but the BT one worked well too. Have seen plenty of vids of the Hybrid Assistant working a treat on the Hybrid AWD.At the end of the day the adapter will likely read the bus just fine, but it's the data rate and the connectivity to the downstream device that the cheap ones tend to be sketchy about.
Sorry if this question has been asked, but is there a way to track our orders?
I keep bouncing from car make to car make, I think I settle on the rav4. Which range? Edge or cruiser? I have no clue, is there option to compare the cars side by side?Also am I reading this right, this car is not in stock?
No point in getting a December car. Get a Jan so it���s a 2021 registration. That���s higher resell value.
Sookie writes...Also am I reading this right, this car is not in stock?Depends on the model and colour but yes it could take up to 2-4 months.Edge or cruiser? ICruiser is your only option if you want Hybrid. Personally I would have happily pay for the Edge if there was a hybrid option.
Ah that���s exactly what happened what I bought my current rav4. 2013 build but it was my14.Can I nominate a delivery build?The biggest difference between the edge and cruiser is the motor?Generally what happens once the hybrid battery hits 10 years?
Sookie writes...The biggest difference between the edge and cruiser is the motor?Personally for me yes. IMO the biggest selling point of the Rav 4 is the Hybrid drive train. Kind of crazy that Toyota is not offering it in the Edge trim as we would have loved the panoramic sun roof and ventilated seat.Having said that, the Cruiser Hybrid AWD is still packed with features.

I don't do much off-roading except once or twice a year on some gravel roads ..Are there any benefits to purchasing  AWD? like more fun to drive? or better re-sale value?ThanksIMO if you are not doing anything other than driving on some dirt roads which are just a bit uneven then a 2WD would be ok. I have a Cruiser but that is only for the towing capacity which can be very variable across the range so if towing is a consideration be mindful of what you buy. Other than that it's really all about whether the model you pick has the extras you desire. Good luck.
dad writes...Does anyone know if its possible to turn off the chiming when the doors are open and if so how. Its annoying when I am sitting in the car in the carport trying to work out all the settings.My Cruiser does the same thing and nothing I do in "Accessory" mode will stop it BUT if I put it into "On" mode without the foot on the brake so not running per se I can open the door with no chimeI know it's stupid that a car that's "On but not started"  has no chime but "Accessory mode" has a chimeWTF

If you plan on driving on dirt tracks, wet/snow roads, etc, then def go with AWD. I only intend to drive in suburban/city areas so I purchased FWD ��� also car will be lighter, maintenance will be cheaper down the track as there is only one motor, and suspect fuel efficiency will be better.
elbakano writes...and suspect fuel efficiency will be better.I don't believe the AWD model uses any extra fuel compared to the 2WD model as the rear wheel are driven purely by the electric motor.
Fwd fuel efficiency is 4.7L combined.AWD is 4.8L combined.*Disclaimer: I don't really know what I'm talking about, but I'm quoting the spec sheet.

How much do I expect to pay for a FWD GXL Hybrid in Melbourne?  Is it worth upgrading to the Cruiser?

Well you do need to factor in the 'slight' extra weight and power from the AWD. *From a comparison article I stumbled across:*Toyota RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid FWD- Claim: 4.8L/100km- Real: 5.3L/100km- Potential fuel tank range: 1037.7kmToyota RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid AWD- Claim: 4.8L/100km- Real: 5.5L/100km- Potential fuel tank range: 1000km

The piece of mind from the AWD is well worth as you'll never know when you'll require the extra grip.
The FWD also has more brake dive when slowing down as all the braking and regen is done on the front wheels.
Thanks everyone for giving views on FWD & AWD...  What I could gather and summarise from the above discussion:+ for FWDSlightly better fuel efficiency Works well for City-Suburban area+ for AWDBetter traction / gripPiece of mind if going to drive on sand /snow somedayOne more question, if anyone from Melbourne (/Victoria) can recommend the Toyota dealer they have bought from and trust? Also, I see the Price from WA & NSW being discussed but couldn't find for Vic.. any price indications for Vic for Cruiser Hybrid  AWD? I see RRP of Cruiser Hybrid AWD listed as $51.6K, so what could be a reasonable price to offer? Please share your views?  Thanks
Melbournefriend writes...I see RRP of Cruiser Hybrid AWD listed as $51.6K, so what could be a reasonable price to offer?I was told that there is still a queue for these vehicles and the higher you offer, the quicker you rise in the queue.

After 10 years of Hybrid fun, do you guys think the hybrid battery will need to be replaced?
are neoprene seat covers ok for the hybrid model?reason why I'm asking is they will most likely inhibit heat evaporation in the rear seat, which is above the battery pack.I presume that's the reason why Toyota only sell fabric genuine seat covers for the model.

Lunchguy writes...But don't people get unique tracking info? That'd prevent this from happening.Not really.  It's easy to put a 'pause' on an order (which isn't really paused).  Any number of excuses can be used.  Early in the thread there were quite a few examples of delivery dates obtained and then extended, some even extended again.  Those excuses were production capacity mostly from memory.   Whilst potentially true, those that paid more seemed to have a shorter wait time than those that managed a great deal.   One poster in here I remember waited I think nearly 7 or 8 months because of the bargain they achieved.  Whilst others waited 8 weeks.But I can't imagine that anyone that does order the Hybrid would be disappointed.   I've the GXL AWDH in Eclipse Black which is 15 months old and I still enjoy driving it as much today as I did when I picked it up.   I've never turned the air con off and still get 5.7 consistently after 35K and I run E10 (hey, the cap says it's suitable).  The fixed price servicing is brilliant.If anyone does have to wait, and I think there's still a bit of a delay between ordering and delivery, it's worth it.

The Subaru boot looks very spacious and it's on my list of potentials for 2021. But I haven't driven either the RAV or the Subi so whichever one doesn't destroy my soul with lack of driving engagement and has the more practical boot will win out.
Thanks everyone here, booked RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser AWD! :)Kayelle, I test drove Forester as well and felt RAV 4 Cruiser Hybrid is better.. Some things which made me decide:1) Running Cost: Servicing & Fuel economy2) Silent engine ��� just so silent in RAV 4 Hybrid ��� so impressed by it3) Every new tech feature ��� safety tech features (adaptive cruise control, lane control etc), 360 degree cam (low res though), apple/android connect, sunroof, wireless charging..4) Comfortable seats 5) feels premium inside (cruiser & edge) Overall it ticks all boxes ��� can't find faults in it..excited now for getting the delivery of the car!Cheers

I felt the Toyota was really lacking internally compared to other makes. The Infotainment system is old boring and clunky, there is no ventilated seats, no power seats for passenger. Front dash and centre console felt old and tired.I loved the internals of the Sportage (top spec GTLine) which I was offered a great deal on. The whole internal is super slick and I loved the panoramic sunroof. Unfortunately we need the space of the RAV4 and Sportage was just that bit too small internally.Wish I could combine the two cars!

I got a $4,400 discount on the Rav4 Edge, but that is because I ordered it.
Anyone have any idea what that tiny shelf that sits on the rhs of the dash under the view and auto headlight switches is for?  Looks like it may come out but can't work out how to. Its too small to put anything on, so cant understand why Toyota put it there.
That looked like it could store access cards or something?
dad writes...Looks like it may come out but can't work out how to. Its too small to put anything on, so cant understand why Toyota put it there.That is where you insert your ID card. The one shaped like a credit card but just a bit thinner.Once the car acknowledges your card, it checks for alcohol limits and then enables the Red button. If you gotta ask what the red button is it likely means you didn't get your ID and you should ignore this response.
NamePlease writes...whichever one doesn't destroy my soul with lack of driving engagementI was with Kayelle when she test drove the RAV4 and we did a separate test drive each. I wasn���t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. It didn���t have much body roll, brakes were great and acceleration was adequate to be confident you can move when you need to, safely.I own a VF II SS Redline and a V8 Torana so my thing is driving engagement with the drama associated with higher powered cars.I���d be happy driving the RAV4 daily for everything I mentioned above and for how well it handles for what it is. It���s no performance car but it���s very comfortable on rough roads and has enough go not to leave you feeling embarrassed.Biggest turn off is the interior feels 10 years behind where it should be. The touch screen isn���t as responsive as it should be and as soon as you wait for that moment for it to do something you start nit-picking other parts of the interior. Most things inside feel added on rather than designed for the vehicle ending up in an interior that isn���t as cohesive as some other brands.The strangest thing for me was the climate control knobs and their shape. The part when you grip the knob tapers down with semi circular lines on the rubber accentuating the taper. When I looked at it I immediately thought of ���nipples��� and just got weirded out by it.

I actually like the actual touch point and if you buy the Cruiser and above model there is nice soft touch every where which makes it feel quite premium.However, like you I am not a big fan of the tack on infotainment and UI, luckily it has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay which solve some of my gripe with the infotainment.Most things inside feel added on rather than designed for the vehicle ending up in an interior that isn���t as cohesive as some other brands.I think Toyota is going for a more rugged look this generation and from that stand point the interior actually suits the design brief.

For most who feels the RAV4 interior is not sufficient wait for the 2022 Lexus NX. It will have the same drive train.

Thanks for the reply. Yeah that���s good to know. The problem is that we only have one Toyota dealership in Townsville. There are dealerships in the cities surrounding us but they���re 2-5 hours drive away, and are smaller towns so are unlikely to have better prices than here in Townsville.

Can't argue with the inclusions such as electric front passenger seat, ventilated front seats, and panoramic glass roof though.

It will probably take around 2 weeks for the ship to get here from Japan and it also depends on how many stops the ship is making between Nagoya and Port Kembla in your case.If I remember correctly in my case the ship left Nagoya on 31/7 and arrived in Melbourne on 18/8. It stopped in Yokohama, Townsville, Brisbane, and Port Kembla along the way. I think some ships will actually skip Townsville and it takes around 1.5 days for the ship to travel between Port Kembla to Melbourne.From my observation the tracker is probably a day behind and I don't think it is updated on the weekends.

Auto folding mirrors is another one, although we're a bit more fortunate than the US in this case considering most models in the US does not even have powered folding mirrors.
It leaves a model update path for the 2019+. The black plastic body panels will get painted in a year or two, remaining halogen light bulbs will be replaced with led, maybe a HUD, for example (& accompanied by annual price increases).

tpgfornow writes...It still the case for GX 2.0 petrol, automatic, in standard color paint + floor mat (VIC) ~ 37k ?that is the amount i have paid for gx hybrid early this year.in GX model, you will have an option with or with out sat nav.in most cases the carpet floormats are provided free, any how you can get good quality all weather floormats incl boot mat between $150-200 from ebay.you should get more discount on petrol models.hybrids models and edge are in demand.
well i paid $38500 for the GX hybrid (thats including all the prices rises recently and boot liner/mat)...floor mats are standard on the GX model now.so why bother with the 2.0L when the hybrid is the go the moment....and also better resale value in the future i guess
Sorry, should have mentioned that. NSW (Sydney).
Yes. DA RRP in NSW is approximately $51.6k for the Cruiser Hybrid AWD.
My brand new car copped a few dings in the Brisbane hail storms yesterday. So sad. But I���m sure a panel beater can easily fix it. Is there risks to leave it?Mostly on the top. Bonnet was fine. And found one in the side. All quite small. These were caused by the 50c size ones. The smaller ones just bounced off
out of curiosity which insurer have people been going with...i've been testing a few online quotes for the gx hybrid (with sat nav) and all the prices seem a bit high...eg around $1200 and most are "market value too"

Thanks. lazydesi. I've heard there had been a price hike, but at least this would give me some basis to negotiate
Thanks IB. It all comes down to the final offering price for me, if there isn't much difference, I will surely aim for the hybrid.

It is possibleVehicles built up to a Tuesday leave Nagoya on the next Friday. One ship per week to Port KemblaAssuming a planned production month of November. If it lines off on the 1st to the 3rd it will leave Nagoya on the 6th. Steaming time to PK is 15 days ie 21st. Wharf processing time is 1-6 days (depends on volume) and transport to metro dealer is max of 3 days. So in theory it could be at the dealer by the 25th.  If the status moves to In transit to Aust on Monday 8th morning you know it made Friday 6th ship.

Hi all,Had a strange thing happened to me today in my Cruiser 2WD Hybrid (purchased Oct 2019).I was in the car by myself. Stopped it at the kerb and got out of the car to get something ��� left the engine running and gears to "P" (car beeped three times when I closed the door from outside, warning me that the engine's still on).  I was absent for 5 min, then I returned to the car, got in, shifted the gear to "D" and started slowly moving in EV mode ��� I only needed to make about 200m to the place where the car was going to be parked, so didn't bother putting my seat belt on. Soon the car started dinging signalling that the seat belt is not fastened. I didn't buckle up, and put the gas pedal down a bit, but the car did not accelerate and just kept just rolling.  I then fastened a seat belt (the car stopped dinging), and tried to accelerate again, but to no avail. I had to stop, shift the gear to "P", then back to "D" and only then the car went normally.Anyone had something like that? Any ideas as to what that could be?
digital_silence writes...Any ideas as to what that could be?Nanny mode . . . you have shown the car you cannot be trusted to drive safely*, so it put you in the seat facing the corner for time-out.When you completed your time-out (seat belt on, car stopped and in Park) it goes back to normal.* I agree with the car . . . driving with no seatbelt, leaving the car running on its own, etc. I am surprised that the car let you back in again!:-P
Even the [strike]silly[/strike] funny comments are expected to show some logic: if she doesn't trust me, why did she let me move from the spot where I left her on her own, and then immobilized me some 25 meters later, basically in the middle of the road, where it is much more dangerous not only for me, but for the other road cyclists?
digital_silence writes...why did she let me move from the spot where I left her on her own, and then immobilized me some 25 meters later, basically in the middle of the road, where it is much more dangerous not only for me, but for the other road cyclists?I think "she" just realized you think she is a cycle and it ain't taking it any more lol.
I work in the Insurance Claims industry (not motor vehicles) so will claim some knowledge. Insurance is probably the purest form of getting what you pay for, factoring in all known risks. It is rather like gambling, with the Underwriter having a huge body of knowledge of the risks involved to help them determined the odds that they offer for differing risks.That can extend to some odd things beyond the obvious ones. Parking on the street is riskier than in your driveway, which is riskier than being in a carport, which is riskier than a locked garage. If your office car park is secure (as mine is) , it is less risky than parking on the street or an open park.Age and driving experience, together with your home and workplace address are obvious modifiers of risk, but you would not intuitively think of things like paint colour. A plain colour is easier to repair, with pearl white especially tricky (and more expensive), so a pearl white car is noticeably pricier to insure from some insurers than a plain white one.The prime thing you should worry about when buying insurance is the quality of service when a claim occurs. There is an excellent comparison site to help you look at the quality of different Insurance products https://www.claimscomparison.com/

Looks like the RAV4 is the biggest selling SUV again for October and interestingly 25% of all Toyotas are hybrids

Thanks Bob.  From what I've seen so far, the website isn't always accurate in terms of what's in the yard.  Either way, phoning around has to be done.

laidbacklush writes...Thanks Bob.  From what I've seen so far, the website isn't always accurate in terms of what's in the yard.  Either way, phoning around has to be done.Another option is to buy interstate and get it delivered to your driveway. Shouldn't cost more than $500.
Although part of me really really wanted to wait for the new 2021 Hyundai Tucson, we bit the bullet and purchased a Cruiser AWD Hybrid today in Atomic Rush. Had to ring around a few dealers, the one we went with ended up tracking one down from interstate for us.Some dealers here in Melbourne did have stock but not the colours we wanted (one dealer said it would be a 6mth wait for other colours!). Another dealer did have the Atomic Rush and also Graphite (my second choice) in stock but they were late coming in with an offer, so we went with the dealer who worked hard for us and tracked down the interstate one.Should have it within the next week or two.I���m still considering treating myself and updating the infotainment  system with an upgraded aftermarket model, but may see what wireless Apple CarPlay units get released in the next 6���12mths.
Yep, ended up finding a Glacier White in Tweed Heads which is just a few hours drive, albeit interstate. Arriving December 1st.Let���s see how we go tomorrow with negotiations. Due to crazy demand I���m not expecting much but who knows.Is it a ball ache to get a car purchased in NSW and registered in QLD?

Hi whirlpool (lol this is my first post)I have put a deposit in late Oct 2020, for a new pearl white RAV4 GXL hybrid 2wd. Compared 5 different dealers in Victoria and got a final price of $40700 DA. I saw people on this forum talking about order tracking but dealer has not gave me any instructions on tracking my order online. Anyone has any ideas?
Gavin. writes...Anyone has any ideas?Welcome to Whirlpool.  If you have a look at the bottom of the page, there's a button(?) that say's 'Archive Version' and this will present the forum as a single page.  From there, you can easily search the text for something like 'order tracking' or whatever you like.  There's a few posts about links to webpages and what's required to log in for the order tracking functionality.Reasonable price (IMO) for the 2WD GLXH.
Gavin. writes...Anyone has any ideas?Relax.The dealer will ring you when the delivery truck with your car rolls up.In the meantime, organise that bank cheque for the balance.

Due to crazy demand I���m not expecting much but who knows.Is it a ball ache to get a car purchased in NSW and registered in QLD?Being that Tweed Heads is ON the QLD/NSW Border, you may be able to get them to register it as a Qld car from new. I have a work acquaintance who bought a new car from Tweed Heads (not Toyota) that where happy to do this. Dont know if this was normal of if it was because it was a deal breaker for them so they organsied it in their case only.
Yep, they have confirmed they can register both sides of the border.One thing I have learnt from reading a similar thread on the Skoda forum is if you're trading your car in for a new car, make sure you factor in any current rego on your vehicle before you sign.Another thing I have learnt is that this dealer is willing to accept photos of my vehicle inside and outside with which he can find a buyer who will offer what my local dealer offered.  This means if I drive to Tweed and the condition of my car matches the photos I sent, I can drive the new car home.  Barring any mishaps along the way of course...like hailstone damage.
Tom1959 Forum RegularI was told here was a long wait when I wanted to buy a RAV4 in Canberra. Also, dealers would not move on RRP + dealer delivery.Rang multiple dealers from in NSW and got a great deal and quick delivery from Watson Toyota in Young. They delivered the car to Canberra and I took care of rego. Worth a phone call.Thanks Tom.  I just gave them a call and the guy was very helpful ��� quoted $48k for hybrid cruiser AWD, crystal pearl and nutmeg interior, likely Feb delivery.   No accessories as I'm not quite sure what I really need yet and they can be added.Is $48k base price pretty reasonable?
I'm in the same boat as you, but mine rose to $51k after ORC.  Haven't put a deposit down yet.They won't budge on RRP but unless I can get them to discount the remaining value on my car's rego, it's a stalemate.  I only renewed mine a few months ago and I resent having to fork out for a new one, even if it is mandatory.
I just spoke to the dealer again to be sure, and mine is $48k drive away, no additional ORC.     So yes, push harder!
Mate I'm amazed you've got them down to that price, good work. From what I've read on here I was convinced there was little to no discount to be had.Thanks for the info.
Can I ask which dealer/state you got that price from?  Purely for my next convo with the dealer.  PM if easier.
Beemer writes...I just gave them a call and the guy was very helpful ��� quoted $48k for hybrid cruiser AWD, crystal pearl and nutmeg interior,I ordered a hybrid cruiser AWD in Atomic Rush with nutmeg interior and towkit included for $48650 D/A in NSW, so your price is pretty good. Ordered from Cessnock Toyota in mid September, estimated delivery late December.
Does anyone have a good price for the Toyota tow kit in Sydney ?I've been quoted $1187 by the dealer, but was wondering if there were cheaper options for the genuine Toyota kit...
In the past when I've had towbars fitted before aftermarket they were around 900 so that doesn't sound too bad for official stuff
Yeah that price sounds good, will be plug and play too so should integrate with the cars parking sensors
Looking to purchase a RAV 4 Cruiser Hybrid 2WD in the next couple of months.  Just wondering what's the best DA price you have obtained previously?I noted that some of you have managed to get a AWD version for $47k DA.How about 2WD version?
hysterical writes...How about 2WD version?I ordered my 2WD back in early September for $47k ��� at that time dealers would not go any lower/they did not want to negotiate at all.
44.5K DA is the lowest I got from dealers in Brisbane two weeks ago. 2wd cruiser blue. Feb delivery.
Wow...the RRP is $48.5 DA for the 2wd cruiser in metallic paint in Melbourne.  I assume you got the standard floor mat & cargo mat?
hysterical writes...Wow...the RRP is $48.5 DA for the 2wd cruiser in metallic paint in Melbourne.  I assume you got the standard floor mat & cargo mat?If you are in NSW ring motorscout. Under $45 should be available from quotes.
No cargo mat, just floor mat.
Bumpy writes...Yeah that price sounds good, will be plug and play too so should integrate with the cars parking sensorsEven the Hayman Reese fitters use OEM plug and play wiring and black box add-ons when required nowadays and Scotchloks are long gone. Why you should haggle a towbar with dealers at purchase time as they have to guarantee it then and it's the electronics that needs to concern you.

Hello all! general question to RAV4 owners, what fuel type are you using? And do you think it is causing any difference to drive quality or Km/lt? The inside of fuel tank got the sticker E10 suitable.. any thoughts? Cheers!
InternalBleeding writes...i don't think you'll find any dealer who'll sell you the car for that price.38k was what I found after scanning through this thread.If this figure was only possible pre- price hike, is 39k likely?
I think that should be doable.
Question ��� is there any literature/links that tells you what colour wheels the AWD Cruiser comes with as standard?  I can't face another convo with the dealer.  I  can't see anything on the Toyota AU website other than the colours change from 2WD (silver) to AWD (black).  I don't want to assume anything.
Only cruiser comes in black.

InternalBleeding writes...so what i mean is...is this info delay by a few hours..or days..?From my experience it seems to be delayed by a day or so and it does not seem to be updated on weekends. My guess is your car is possibly on the Hamburg Highway. Your dealer would definitely know which ship your car is on so you can ask them about it.
ok cool. would you know which port they usually pick up the rav4's destined for Australia?is it Nagoya or Osaka?
RAV4 Is produced in Toyota's Nagoya plant.
yeah cool...yeah then your correct my car should be on the HAMBURG highway...as that departed on the 5th and Trans Future 6 doesn't leave Nagoya till the 10th.
Melbournefriend writes...what fuel type are you using? And do you think it is causing any difference to drive quality or Km/lt?I am using ULP95 in my Cruiser Hybrid. Paying over $40K for the car, and saving $3 a week on the U95-E10 price difference does not make sense to me ��� the car deserves a good treatment fot a longer life.  As  Feuerbach wisely said "We are what we eat". All imho.
InternalBleeding writes...yeah cool...yeah then your correct my car should be on the HAMBURG highway...as that departed on the 5th and Trans Future 6 doesn't leave Nagoya till the 10th.Following your progress closely. As our Cruiser AWD has been sitting in "Schedule for Production" status for about a week now with an ETA pick up of the 13th of December.Would have thought the car would atleast be "in production" status by now.
I have been trying to turn down the rear tailgate beeping sound for Open/Close, after googling apparently the volume can be turned down but I can't getting into the settings when I select ok in the menu icons in front of the steering wheel, any thoughts?"Another way to customize the power liftgate is in the Multi-Information Display. Using the steering wheel-mounted controls, go to the Settings menu. Scroll to the PBD (or Power Back Door) icon and select it"https://www.toyotaofnaperville.com/how-to-use-toyota-power-liftgate/
"anyone know how accurate or far off the tracking website is"Excluding WA (independent distributor) vehicle tracking is updated in real time and reflects TMCA's system. Vehicle tracking only shows about 6 different statuses whereas a Dealers sees maybe 30 and TMCA about 50. For simplicity vehicle tracking statuses are grouped into areas relevant to a guest/customer. Sometimes a status can move through 6 changes in an hour. Calculating the customer eta on production is a very very complex formula. (I know as I worked fine tuning it for many years) The number of variables that can effect it is quite staggering. It can be as simple as 2 ships docking at the same time, or just one part not available when the vehicle is processed on the wharf because the delivery truck had an accident.  Add to that typhoons, shipments being quarantined, strikes, hail, vendors unable to supply on time, and that not even considering CO-VID19. Trust me the aim is to get the vehicle to the dealer as soon as practical without damage.
Anyone have any idea what the factory option '3A Cruiser-2WD (SS)' would be, on an AWD cruiser model ??!
Anyone provide any feedback on the toyota tracking portal.We put a deposit down on a gx hybrid in sept, said it would build in nov for dec delivery.The tracking portal is still blank with and production or delivery details.Did people experience it updating only when it was basically complete and shipped?
speak or email your dealer...nothing showed up on mine till i spoke to the dealer and he said my one was slotted for early November build.maybe a day or two after i spoke to the dealer...the website updated with the scheduled build date and  estimated delivery time.
Out of interest, does anyone know what 'solution' would be in the wiper fluid when picked up from the dealer?Previous cars I have usually just filled it up with tap water (have also tried a vinegar and dish detergent combo), but whatever the dealer (or when it was manufactured) does a great job of clearing the windscreen.
Could probably ask for some when it goes for service?

mmcr writes...Anyone have any idea what the factory option '3A Cruiser-2WD (SS)' would be, on an AWD cruiser model ??!Not sure what you mean by your question. Assuming you are asking about a Hybrid.  3A refers to the base suffix. Base suffix is the base specification for each model grade. (in this case a Cruiser)   Cruiser -2WD (SS) is the short version description.  SS refers to space saver tyre. The are no factory options on a 2WD so it only has 1 suffix ��� 3A.The AWD Cruiser has no factory options either so its description should be  3A Cruiser-AWD (SS) as its base suffix is also 3A.
Transatlanticism writes...(have also tried a vinegar and dish detergent comboPlease don't use that, newer plastic and rubber parts don't deal well with vinegar not to mention the damage of the acid on the paint over which it will run.Dish Detergents produce too much bubbling so when it sprays out it, it may not spray properly depending on the specific one used.Vinegar is slightly acidic whilst dish wash is alkaline, chemical reaction may form solid particulates which might block your tube/nozzle.If you have a lot of highway travel, get BarBug or something of the like, otherwise any windscreen wash will do.

mmcr writes...What did they give you for the Mazda 3 ?We weren���t too concerned about how the dealer priced the vehicles as long as we got a 35k changeover (or as close as possible). I���ll have to look at the paperwork to get the exact numbers.One dealer didn���t budge from 38k so when we found our dealer who went $800 off our asking price straight away with what we wanted we didn���t argue. Not worth it when he genuinely tried to get what we wanted.

What do you think about the tints? Has anyone got them re-tinted to a darker percentage?
What is the best price anyone in WA able to get for RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid 2wd or Awd?For Awd i am not able to get anything less than 50k drive away without any extras.

Sorry for the silly question, but how do I exactly ADD apps to my rav4. I want to put google maps on there. I've paired my phone via Bluetooth and it has all my phone contacts etc. I've lugged it in via USB, but cant see how I actually move APPS over onto the rav4. Any assistance is appreciated.

Has anyone done any work to there rear camera with upgrading it? As well as centre display unit? Just want to enhance the quality. Any ideas on potential solutions?
My local car audio shop recommended the brand ���Echo Master���. Haven���t looked into it but a ballpark cost they gave me was $400-500 supplied and installed.Edit: Upon investigation, this brand also makes Thinkvue cameras which are pretty high quality.

Blackvue DR900S-2Ch, originally with the Power Magic Pro. Got it installed by a premium Blackvue dealer, set to 12V, Infinity. Was advised if the car is sitting longer than 2 or 3 days without being used, to unplug the camera, as it could still drain the cars 12V battery.I found with the lockdown, that the parking mode time was getting shorter and shorter, till eventually it wouldn't stay on when the car was parked. The car would still start, but the voltage was low enough to stop the PMP from supplying power.I ended up getting the Blackvue B-124X battery and removing the PMP. The B-124X is wired into the fuse box so it charges very quickly and allows a very long parking time. Because I don't drive every day, I wired in a switch so I can turn off the camera when I'm parked in my garage.
I've had my Rav4 Hybrid for 18 months (lucky huh?)I continue to be very pleased with it ��� great car.One niggle.The internal rear view mirror is supposed to be auto-dimming.The little green light is on.It doesn't dim with headlights from the rear ��� it doesn't do anything.At the two services it's had I've asked for it to be checked.The mechanic checked it against a new Rav4 ��� he thought it didn't do anything either.Any comments on this?
garax writes...It doesn't dim with headlights from the rear ��� it doesn't do anything.To check it properly, locate the sensor facing the front (facing the windscreen) and cover it with your finger, then shine a torch into the sensors either side of the "Auto" button or green LED, you should see the mirror dim.

Thx for the information.I tried it and there was a dimming effect.However, I don't understand why there would be a sensor on the forward-facing front of the mirror when it's supposed to dim for headlights coming from behind.What am I missing?
I think the front sensor is to detect if it's daylight / night time and the sensor in the mirror part detects any headlight beams behind you

Hey All!What prices are people getting in Vic for the 2WD Cruiser Hybrid in Graphite? We went for a test drive and really liked it but Toyota wouldn't budge from listed price of $48.5k.Admittedly we didn't try too hard because this was the first of a few cars in the med-suv range we wanted to test to narrow down which ones we liked.
You can check the posts in the past few months to confirm, but from memory you should be able to get it for around 45 to 46k. I ordered mine (2WD cruiser Hybrid blue) for 44.8K but I am in Brisbane.

Anyone know what the difference is between the hold button and the handbrake. I know the hold activates after you hold the brake pedal down for a couple of seconds but what is the physical difference and what is the need to have 2 methods ?
dad writes...Anyone know what the difference is between the hold button and the handbrake. I know the hold activates after you hold the brake pedal down for a couple of seconds but what is the physical difference and what is the need to have 2 methods ?Hold button is for when you stop and not parking (at traffic lights for example). When activated and you come to a stop, press the brake pedal, the hold light goes on or off (can't remember which) and you can then release the brake pedal.It will hold for 2 minutes without your foot on the pedal. Press the accelerator and the brake will release and away you go. Park brake is for when you're parked.
dfishkeeper writes...According to Red Book the Silver Sky is a metallic paint option and 1D6 is the paint code shown on my compliance plate, so i don't know where you are getting your information from ~Have you actually tried a metallic touch up paint? I have with various brands where they match the manufacturers paint code but it still doesn���t match when you apply it. It���s to do with the metallic content which reflects light and less to do with the colour.That���s why body shops repaint the whole panel and blend it in with the adjoining panels.

Bob Loblaw writes...I can see some value of updating Toyota maps if you want updated alerting ��� eg new school zones, fixed speed cameras etc.I agree. I quite like the inbuilt maps due to the features. Also the fact that it doesn���t need to be connected to the internet for traffic information and all means I could use it on trips to some areas without a good range. It���s surprisingly good for an inbuilt navigation system! I was prepared to use google maps when I first got it, but this changed my mind.

To be honest I don���t have any problems with Toyota���s sat nav. It���s easy to use, integrates with the MID in front of you and does its job. Sure the GUI might look a little cramped compared to Google Maps but it���s never failed to take me from A to B with the shortest distance.

Think stopping at a red light.Electronic brake is designed as a 'permanent' brake when parked.Realized all that as I always use the hold function, find it very usefull.Probably should have worded it better but was meaning to ask how do they work.Does the hand-brake work on the rear discs and does the hold function work the same, or maybe puts a lock on the electric motors? Maybe hold only works with the ignition on? Just curious.

So....after days of avoidance tactics and inability to provide a straight answer on if/when a deposit has been taken on our new Rav 4 Cruiser AWD, the dealer has just told me our car has been "mistakenly allocated to someone else".  They really do take the biscuit.  How do they ever hope to change the public perception of car salesman with this kind of stuff?We are not talking about a dodgy 2nd hand car sales company here.  I don't know why I'm surprised but I am surprised.

i guess that depends on how busy the dealer is...the 4th is indicative only...mine still says 1/12/20 and its almost the 2nd of december...haha
Will check in with our dealer early next week as  the last update we received they were hoping to receive the car by the 8th of December.

Extra accessories are only tint and cargo mat. full tank fuel and floor mat are standard.I was ready to pay the deposit when I visited these dealers.Ferntree Gully. I did my test drive there. I didn't push harder, only asked what's the best price they can offer which is $50.2k.Waverley Toyota. I targeted $48k. Sales went to see manager. they offered $50k and won't accept $48k.Chadstone Toyota. Sales became impatient when I offered $48k. Then I raised to $49k. Sales only willing to do a few hundred off. I didn't get to the "ask my manager" part. "wasting time" said from that sales there and asked me to be realistic.

kkm2010 writes...Thank you so muchNo worries, I���ll whim you the salesman I spoke to. When I was dealing with him I had already test drove what we wanted elsewhere and told him exactly what we wanted. There���s was no need for him to sell us anything, straight to ���can you do this price?���He asked how soon we were willing to buy and I said if he can meet me on price, I���d buy that day...which I would have. I think it helps if they know you���re ready to go.Buying cars can be painful but if you���ve done the research and you have a realistic price you want to pay then just ditch all the salespeople who waste your time. No one needs that grief when you���re handing over substantial amount of money.

Might be a long shot, but was selling my X-Trail and was looking at buying a Hybrid RAV4. Went to the first dealer today who said that there was a 3 month wait on the hybrid :(Has anyone had any luck in Victoria on managing to get a Hybrid RAV4 within a month? Potentially even one in stock? Not keen on waiting 3 months on a car, but at the same time really love the car
MyInternetIsSlow writes...Has anyone had any luck in Victoria on managing to get a Hybrid RAV4 within a month?Yep we did. Said yes to the car on a Wednesday, and drove it off the lot on Friday 10 days later.
MyInternetIsSlow writes...Potentially even one in stockFerntree Gully Toyota had one GRAPHITE color Cruiser Hybrid in stock as I visited yesterday. can't bargain the price. Not sure if still there or not.
gmailaccount writes...Just because a salesperson won't meet a certain price doesn't mean they are wasting anyones time.No, Frankston wasted my time. We gave them all the chances they needed to show if they wanted to do a deal but instead they used the usual tactics to keep us on the floor. We were always polite and when I pushed them harder I was given $200 off. When I said no they immediately tried selling us a 2WD version in a different colour. This is after clearly telling them exactly the model and colour we wanted. We just walked away.The dealer we bought from didn���t argue. Came very close on the first quote which undercut Frankston by over 3k which shows we were fair with what we asked.We're in the middle of a global pandemic, car supply is low, demand is high. Its the job of the salesperson to sell vehicles they have, for the most amount of money possible.I don���t deal with excuses. If I kept giving excuses to my boss, I wouldn���t have a job for long. A buyer���s job is to do their research and approach a salesperson fairly and reasonably. We did, we got our deal and now we relay that info to others who may want to buy.  We all understand a salesperson���s job isn���t necessary easy but it���s a free market. There���s always a dealership who will be motivated to sell if you search for long enough.
MyInternetIsSlow writes...Has anyone had any luck in Victoria on managing to get a Hybrid RAV4 within a month?Kayelle writes...Yep we did. Said yes to the car on a Wednesday, and drove it off the lot on Friday 10 days later.Kayelle and I had a salesperson who managed to ship one over from interstate. From the time I first stepped in to the showroom to the time we picked ours up, they pretty much wiped out their stock including the cars on the showroom floor. It was incredible to see how many cars they shifted in such a short time so I guess it���s luck of the draw.
Anyone bought an aftermarket heads up display unit for Rav cruiser hybrid?
Yes, bought a SuperCheapAuto gps one for $89 and it works well. Already had  SCA and Repco OBD2 huds but they didnt work with hybrid vehicles, a common problem apparently.Use the Toyota digital speedo and it shows exactly the same speed as the aftermarket hud.
Not sure, but shouldn't the original speedometer be reading a little less than the gps accessory?I have understood that vehicle manufacturers are required by law to have speedometers reading under actual and Toyotas read 100 kph when doing just over 90 kph.
Any HUD that doesn���t connect to the car computer will show a different reading and won���t be perfectly in synch.
What prices are people getting in Vic for the 2WD Cruiser Hybrid in Graphite? We went for a test drive and really liked it but Toyota wouldn't budge from listed price of $48.5k.Toyota Nunawading was will to go down to $44,850 drive away. No extras though.
Bob Loblaw writes...Any HUD that doesn���t connect to the car computer will show a different reading and won���t be perfectly in synch.That was my initial worry when I couldn't get my obd2's to work but 99.9% of the time it reads exactly the same as the car speedo and even when it doesn't it's only 1kph out for a second.

My pick up ETA just got moved from the 14th to the 16th of December.@InternalBleeding, are you still on track to pick up the car this week?

Damn Dirty Apes writes...No, Frankston wasted my time. We gave them all the chances they needed to show if they wanted to do a deal but instead they used the usual tactics to keep us on the floor.Yep. I test drove a rav4 at a dealer. I had a trade in and they priced it at 10k below market value trying to be greedy thinking I don���t know my cars giving me reasons that are obvious lies. And I wasn���t going to trade in if the price wasn���t right but they kept on insisting that they are doing me a favor.Walked away and didn���t end up buying a RAV4, but instead a near new Lexus hybrid SUV at another dealership.Doesn���t matter how committed someone is at the car, all it takes is a bad experience to put off buying one all together.

picked up my Nov Build Povo GX Hybrid today.. :-)typical Toyota I guess, but I do enjoy the car.Couple of shortcomings..The Sunglasses holder, that should be much deeper...I cant get my sunglasses to fit in there.Also does anyone else hear a relay clicking in the footwell each time you press the brake pedal?I don't know if that's normal for all hybrids..so I'm curious if anyone else notices this, and you can hear it when the car is in hybrid mode as its very quiet inside the car.I also bought genuine Toyota seat covers, and they are actually very good quality and fit. I was actually quite surprised by this. Are they worth the expensive price? hmm probably not..maybe half. But they are actually quite good...not the typical seat cover quality.
InternalBleeding writes...picked up my Nov Build Povo GX Hybrid today.. :-)typical Toyota I guess, but I do enjoy the car.Congrats on getting the Rav4, I am sure you will enjoy it.lso does anyone else hear a relay clicking in the footwell each time you press the brake pedal?I don't know if that's normal for all hybrids..sNever heard this myself, I am not sure if it's normal.
InternalBleeding writes...picked up my Nov Build Povo GX Hybrid today.. :-)Congratulations. I wouldn't call it 'povo' ��� even the base model hybrid is a fantastic car compared to most of the competition and has all of the fundamental quality Toyota engineering and driveline as the Cruiser anyway. If you like driving it that's all that matters. It will still be a much nicer car than many people drive anyway, the average vehicle age in Aus is 10 years.
thanks :-)apparently that noise is normal...its supposedly the relay kicking in/on the vacuum pump for the brakes.since the hybrid doesn't have a conventional vacuum brake assist.I just hope the relay clicking noise dies down slightly after a while...as once you hear it..you can't un hear it hahaits a nice car...i do think however the base models should have full keyless entry...other cars in that price range have that as standard...(but i guess not the hybrid system...even my friends 2013 suzuki swift is full keyless entry/start).
ohh another thing i've noticed and i hope this is evident and normal for other hybrid owners...it seems toyota has put alot of silicone around or on the head gasket...you can see the silicone everywhere...
InternalBleeding writes...picked up my Nov Build Povo GX Hybrid today.. :-)Congratulations!!Also does anyone else hear a relay clicking in the footwell each time you press the brake pedal?From memory I also noticed this during my test drive.Our car has been sitting at Port Kembla since last Saturday and still no movement.

Picked up a red cruiser hybrid for $46000 today in Victoria. Delivery estimate for March.
which dealership in Victoria Squidgy? any extras added?
I am thinking of just getting the petrol cruiser, simply because I need the car urgently in mid January. Moving to a new work, Any thoughts?
No extras, at Croydon
lctan writes...I am thinking of just getting the petrol cruiser, simply because I need the car urgently in mid January. Moving to a new work, Any thoughts?Really depends on how much you drive and usage pattern.- If you drive a lot (20,000km+ per year) then you'll likely to reap the benefit of the fuel savings. Break even point is around 70,000-80,000km from what I've read.- Petrol Cruiser is ~30kW down on power compared to the Hybrid (131kW vs 160kW (2WD) or 163kW (AWD)) so it will struggle more in certain conditions.- Less towing capacity vs Hybrid AWD (800kg braked 750kg unbraked vs 1500kg braked 750kg unbraked on the Hybrid AWD) although still better compared to the Hybrid 2WD which can't really tow anything.Personally, I think even without considering the fuel savings and towing capability, the Hybrid will be the nicer car to drive because of the extra power. Maybe try and contact multiple dealers to see if they have stock coming soon or cancellations if possible?
D3lusion writes...Congratulations!!thank you. i was speaking to the dealer and he was saying the deliveries are going to balloon out again to six months.as for the silicone question I've figured it out...looks like these engines have a separate head in regards to the camshaft.so the camshaft is located in a sub assembly separate to the head...so hence that's why I can see silicone...because that camshaft sub assembly is siliconed to the top of the head.
also can any owners with the higher spec rav4 (ie cruiser or edge) in your centre console compartment, do you have a little tray inside? or is it just a big empty box.apparently some rav4s (USA..possibly the EU) have this little tray insidehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEe6rg_ftas&feature=youtu.be&t=892

Has anyone had an issue with headlight "light throw"?My old 20yo car seem to have a better throw than my new RAV?
I'll have to chase one up from the parts department.Also correct me if I'm wrong but I've noticed with the blind spot monitor.. The indicator icons flash on the mirrors but the car doesn't make a beeping sound.Is that correct. It's a bit disappointing that it doesn't beep.
InternalBleeding writes...Also correct me if I'm wrong but I've noticed with the blind spot monitor..

Personally, I prefer it only having visual cue's only rather than with beeps/sounds notification as well.
Slic writes...Has anyone had an issue with headlight "light throw"?My old 20yo car seem to have a better throw than my new RAV?See many comments around this on the 2020 Rav4 facebook page. I believe the service department can help adjust the headlight level so the throw will be better/further out.
InternalBleeding writes...It's a bit disappointing that it doesn't beep.... but does it beep if you turn on the indicator on the side where the light is on?
No.. It doesn't. Mazdas beep when you have the bsm light on and turn on the signal.With the Rav4 when you put the indicator on it will just blink in the mirror indicating there is a car there..Looking through the manual the option isn't available to enable the beeping even through the dealer ????
Sorry, I thought you meant this tray.https://www.amazon.com.au/JOJOMARK-Accessories-Console-Organizer-Secondary/dp/B07W1DPLZSThe Tray Kayelle linked above came standard.I'm sure the service department can give you one. Can't imagine it costing more than a few dollars.

Exactly right. For rear traffic alert it beeps but as mentioned I like it in the mazdas when it both beeps and blinks on the mirror when you have a car approaching or on the side
Hi Folks,Can someone please provide me with real world fuel economy figures for either or both the 2WD or AWD hybrid Rav 4's?I do a lot of highway driving (around 180km day) to get to work. Do they get close the the numbers Toyota quote? Thanks!
well my car only has 100km on it...and the average at the moment is showing 5.9L /100km with about 50% on the highway.still early days yet.. but with the types of driving and where I drive I think i should be able to get 5.5L /100km if not less.
Outta Track writes...Can someone please provide me with real world fuel economy figures for either or both the 2WD or AWD hybrid Rav 4's?currently at ODO reading 4350, do approx 100 kms every day ,  2WD hybrid the best I saw 5.2  and worst 5.7.driving in all modes.
I got 4.8L once on a trip. Average 5.8L per refill.Warmer weather should improve its economy.
Is $40k a good price for a FWD GX Hybrid 2021 model? Only looking at the GX due to the full size spare.The new model is suppose to include extra usb ports, premium steering wheel, all speed EAB and push button start.
We test drove a cruiser for the wifes car yesterday, she really liked it other than:- blind spot indicators hard to notice, seemed a bit undersized.- similarly speedo is a bit small as digital, particularly without a heads up display.- rear window defrosting grid was very noticeable looking through rear view mirror.They're all pretty minor and I imagine you get used to them after a while?
You do but I still find the digital speedo a bit small. Frustrating that there is no HUD, I���m looking for an aftermarket one. My wife has 2017 CX5 and it has HUD and you get used to it. Blind spot monitors you get used to but as mentioned above would have been good if they beeped, which the CX5 does. Maybe they will do these on the next update.
My fuel economy over a year has averaged 6.44l/100km, but that is heavily influenced by the 8 months in lockdown, where I was frequently sitting in car with heater running (worst was 9.08) . In the conditions you describe about 5.5 to 6.3 is what i have achieved without babying the car. Best performance is in stop-start traffic with air conditioner and lights off, where I get 4.3 l/100km. The digital readout on the dashboard is pretty accurate
Just clocked up 9 months today in the AWD Cruiser Hybrid. 948.488 litres to travel 17,606kms. So 5.387 l/100km. Aircon is on all the time set to 23 deg. Mix of highway & town driving. Have been able to use EV mode around town but only when battery is fairly full. Drive in Eco mode up to 80km/hr and Normal mode above that. Best I've got was 3.2l/100km for town. Worst was the first tank at 6.3l/100kms. Best car I've owned.

i am looking to get Rav4 Hybrid  awd cruiser in pearl white, has anyone managed to score one under $50k? i went to Terry shields very firm price, pretty much rrp
Noticed one funny thing.I drive on M2 almost every day. Usually I turn on the cruise ctrl and lane departure assist. The LDA beeps every time just before the car is going through the tollgate, no matter how firmly I hold the wheel or how fast or how steady I drive it through the gate.Every single time. Followed by the normal tag beep. Wondering if the LDA system is sensing the tollgate RFID field, which disturbs it somehow.Anyone who drives through the tollgate ��� did you notice anything like that?
hippyhippy writes...My corolla has a hud .. the Toyota hud is really good ... no idea why it's not offered ... blame Toyota Australia i guessToyota Australia have a history of removing features so the RAV4 is affordable and so it doesn't cannibalise Lexus sales. If the Toyota and Lexus are too similar then nobody would buy the Toyota.It is interesting to note that the Lexus NX300 has a HUD. I heard the RAV4 and NX300 are quite similar underneath the bonnet. Might be worth investigating if the Lexus part can be retrofitted into the RAV.
dhook writes...i am looking to get Rav4 Hybrid  awd cruiser in pearl white, has anyone managed to score one under $50k?If you're willing to travel, Cessnock Toyota in the Hunter Valley will do an AWD Cruiser in metallic paint with a towbar for $48700. A work colleague and I both got that price, we spoke to a salesman called Tom. That's for an order though, floor stock is RRP. Wait time for orders is about 3 months.
I didnt purchase one but i was quoted 49k drive away as a friend put me in contact. As i didnt go any furthar i did not attempt to negotiate harder but feel like there was room to move, particularly noting this thread. That was in OctoberThat was meant for Tyrial, forgot to quote...
Bob Loblaw writes...I heard the RAV4 and NX300 are quite similar underneath the bonnet.Compared to the old RAV4 or the current one? Pretty sure the Lexus NX is pre-TNGA.Toyota Australia have a history of removing features so the RAV4 is affordable and so it doesn't cannibalise Lexus sales.Completely agree on this, although I think for the RAV4 it's Toyota in general and not just Toyota Australia. The US has similar issues such as unlit window switches and no HUD option.
Was driving on Whitehorse road towards city (Blackburn), near Blackburn road T-junction... noticed speed sign sensor picked up something to say the speed limit is 110km... has anyone seen something like this? No biggie.. just thought it was interesting.. curious to know what triggered this, as it is a 60 or 70k limit road.
Getting delivery of my Edge model this week.Reading the posts above in relation to fuel mileage, sort of wish I went with a Hybrid model. I just loved in the orange ascents and interior of the Edge which the Hybrids didn't have which won me over.
Still no movement since the car reached Port Kembla last week.ETA is showing 14th of December for pick up but car is still in "Being Prepared for Transport" status.
For those of you with the cruiser hybrid, if you had the choice of the standard black tyres of the cruiser or the silver tyres of the GXL, which would you pick? Pattern and dimension wise, both tyres are identical, only the colour is different.
Black for me since it complements the Graphite exterior paint and black leather accented interior in my opinion.

So given the COVID situation, what are people seeing in terms of pricing for a Rav4 Cruiser Hybrid Fully spec edition? So AWD, grey paint etc. Website says $51.6K.
GAM89 writes...So given the COVID situation, what are people seeing in terms of pricing for a Rav4 Cruiser Hybrid Fully spec edition?

Awesome!! Thanks for the info :)
Picked up the Edge yesterday. Great car overall. Super easy to drive.Cons so far:- resolution on the screen is bad. Surely they could have improved upon this - Still haven't managed to turn off the voice and beeping when over the speed limit. The car detects speed signs (no I am not a speedster and do not speed)- The ventilated seats are quite loud when you place the cooling seats on. I have a Range Rover Velar and it makes no where near as sound as this.- slight sound when air con is runningOverall great car and am happy I proceeded with the Edge. Love the orange ascents and the seats (Softex and not leather). Very comfortable.

The screen quality itself is also not the best. It is night and day comparison compared to the screen on the Range Rover Velar.
arashyyy_88 writes...Cons so far:- resolution on the screen is bad. Surely they could have improved upon thisNo they can���t as the RAV4 is built to a price point. Every cent counts. You can have a look at a 28 year old Toyota Soarer and the reversing camera is very clear even at night. It���s the first production car to have a backup camera.Funny how Toyota used to be so innovative but now they just do run of the mill cars.

Sorry if this has been asked before:1. Can the school zone notifications be set to only happen during school hours ?

Today I drove 300km (mix of highway and lots of roadwork/congestion speeds !) in my brand new Cruiser Hybrid.Good things:- Very easy to drive. Good visibility, and feels very nimble and car-like for its size.- Very smooth; plenty of grunt when needed without making a fuss about it, and really seamless power delivery. My previous car was a turbo diesel; the turbo diesel felt more effortless when climbing serious hills, but the hybrid's lack of turbo lag makes up for it- Coming from an older car, I'm enjoying CarPlay and the speed camera/school zone alerts (though it's annoying that the school zone alerts come on even outside of school hours)- Radar cruise control ��� awesome ! I can pretty much drive pedal-free :)Gripes:- The interior, and particularly the driver dash is a bit of a mess. Could really benefit from a (factory) HUD- Similarly, the entertainment unit is harder to navigate than the 2020 Kia Cerato I got as a rental a few weeks ago- More than one USB port in the front console would have been good (having them in the centre bin is less helpful)- Not giving the front passenger seat motorised adjustment seems really cheap on a 50k carEdit:- the 'premium' JBL sound system is not worth any extra money- The side mirrors still don't auto-fold when locking. Wtf ?! ��� I'm a doofus, they do auto-fold :)All in all pretty happy ��� looking forward to 20+ years of trouble free motoring :)

The Toyota dealer told me one of his customers nearly had an accident when they expected radar to be on when in fact it wasn't (and expected the car to slow down automatically behind another).(though it's annoying that the school zone alerts come on even outside of school hours)I wish there's a way to selectively 'forget' certain school zones so it doesn't repeat every single time. Also I find the GPS to be very sensitive with school zones ��� for example, one school zone I frequently drive through would have the entering/exiting the school zone warning in quick succession and repeat itself twice.Rendog writes...and the tail gate noise when closingYou can get the dealer to make it only sound once (make one beep).

anyone know how to disable the beeping sound when the boot automatically opens/closes? also, would manually forcing the boot to open/close cause any damages down the track? (not sure whether to let it automatically do its thing or manually force it)
You need to get the Toyota dealership to do disable the beep. Note that there always has to be one beep at a minimum.No idea about manually closing it with force, check the manual.

The driver is responsible, not the tech.It isn't perfect either, ie when the radar/camera/sensors are dirty or inclement weather, it may have issues or not work.If a car merges ahead of you where the ACC has been maintaining a 'safe gap', the ACC is likely to brake heavily, much more than a normal driver would.https://www.toyota.com.au/toyota-safety-sense/active-cruise-controlPlease note: This technology is a driver-assist feature only.

The nutmeg trim in the cruiser looks fab. I decided to stick to the GX as i need a full size spare for country trips, shame it would not fit in the higher spec models.
BigNet writes...Anyone is aware of the water leak from the roof rail that experienced by Overseas owners.For those with GXL and above, can you please go to the back of the black roof rail and give it a really gentle shake side to side and see if the rails give this knock knock noise of too much play of the plastic plug that attaches to the car body. The roof rail design is very poor with 10 holes (total) in the roof rail channels cavity where all the water will channel into and is reliant on plastic clips with very thin rubber gasket to keep it water tight. If it leaks just at the C pillar, it���ll hit the curtain airbag.

If so you will pay a premium or just lucky.  52K seems a lot and is more than you would pay if you ordered a new RAV4 Cruiser and waited 4 months for delivery.I don't know what eFour means (not in the brochure).  But at that price you would certainly expect Hybrid with AWD.  A Cruiser can be petrol 2WD, hybrid 2WD or hybrid 4WD  ��� all at different price points.

Hi folks, will rav4 2021 models get TSS 2.5+ or atleast 2.5 version? TIA
I doubted it was possible but I just did 500kms since last fill up and averaged 5.1l in regional NSW, going to do another 300kms tomorrow for I get home, I super keen to seen if I go the entire trip on 1 tank

gilby writes...I don't know what eFour means (not in the brochure).From the Toyota Global website https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/27541875.htmlAs hybrid vehicles that employ a 4WD system, RAV4 hybrid models leverage a new E-Four that inherits cutting-edge hybrid technology. In concert with increased maximum torque of the rear wheels, a new control system allows torque distribution to the front and rear wheels to be changed from between 100:0 to 20:80. Optimized control of torque distribution to the front and rear wheels during cornering enhances steering stability. An increase in rear-wheel torque contributes to a sense of safety when starting the car on inclines in snow or rain.

Any news of a updated model with a updated infotainment system/gauge cluster and cameras coming any time soon?

Auto lock usually refers to the doors locking once the car starts moving.
There���s plenty of auto lock functionsAuto lock when car is movingAuto lock when car is moved into driveAuto lock when no one is in the carAuto lock when you unlock the car and no one gets in
Ok thanks.What I was specifically referring to was the doors automatically locking once the ignition is turned off and you have exited the car with the car keys on you, and you walk away from the car.My Mazda had this feature and I loved it (and had gotten used to it) and the Toyota doesn���t seem to have this. Because I���m still getting used to the RAV4 and so used to the Mazda having this feature, I often walk away at the shops and accidentally leave the car unlocked. I just need to train myself better to lock it.

Dealer had a few cancelled Cruiser hybrid orders come through so I managed to grab a 2WD which has already landed in the country. Pick up 2nd week of January.Judging by the prices stated here and in the Facebook group I paid a premium for it but happy to do so to get the car now and not wait the 6 or so months in the waiting line.

Rendog writes...There is very little change between FY20 and FY20 modelsI would dare to go one step further and claim that there is no change whatsoever... :-)Continued on the funny talk note, I found what I would describe as a privacy flaw, although it is unclear whether it should be attributed to RAV4 or rather to the phone. Here goes:Suppose you have your phone generally paired with your car via Bluetooth (BT), but they are not connected at this moment. Suppose you are at home, your car is in the garage downstairs, so the phone is not BT-connected to the car, and you just browsed through a p0rn site from your phone (not telling your wife and kids) and this is your last opened tab in ur browser, after which you put the phone aside and walked to the kitchen to have a bite to eat. Surely, you have a security screen lock on your phone (passworded with numbers or pattern), so the phone now locks itself up, and secure screen notifications are set to off. So you are safe as in noone can see what was open on your phone. Suppose your wife says "Let's all go shopping!", and all you and ur fam jump into the car (your phone is in your pocked, still locked). You turn on the car, and the infotainment shows the default screen with audio section in the top left corner. The car connects via BT to the phone (which is still locked!) and ��� voila! ��� that car's screen audio section now displays the name of the last track played and the URL! (say "sugar coogar" at "p0rntube.cum" :-)))  Now watch your half's eyebrows to go up... :-) Note that the phone was securely locked all that time.Jokes aside, I don't want anyone to see my browser tabs, whether that has anything to do with the indecent content or not...
digital_silence writes...Now watch your half's eyebrows to go up... :-)Note that the phone was securely locked all that time.Jokes aside, I don't want anyone to see my browser tabs, whether that has anything to do with the indecent content or not...Certainly a different kind of "trans" issue. One being the horrible CVTs, the other being something else entirely.
digital_silence writes...Note that the phone was securely locked all that timeNot really, because it auto connected to a previously paired device. There's much convenience there, not so much privacy nor security.

I was in the car by myself and I don't even remember what that "currently playing" track was that got displayed. It was pretty innocent, like another border closure announcement prime minister speech... :-) What caught my attention is that I always mentally put that security boundary to my locked phone, like when it's locked, no information should be able to go across that boundary, no matter what this info is. So I was surprised to see that this was not the case.I spoke about this with cybersecurity specialists and they reckon it is a border line, but still on a legit side of things. The digital metadata (such as track name and url) is considered to be a part of the track contents, along with its audiovisual contents. So, if you have set to use your car as a mmedia player, you accept that metadata to be displayed for the "currently playing" track only. This can be changed in the individual Bluetooth connection properties, but only as enabling/disabling a whole multimedia playback functionality using the car infotainment.

Can the front and rear cameras be replaced to get better quality? And would the centre screen also need to be replaced? Finding the quality pretty poor compared to our Mazda. If anyone has done can you provide some suggestions, was going to try Jaycar.
Is anyone else's front windscreen wipers smearing water on the return stroke? We had a bit of rain in Sydney this week and whenever the wipers return to the original position on the down stroke, it leaves behind a very noticeable water mark on the windscreen directly in front of the driver's view. This is quite distracting as the mark is right at my eye level. I've only had the car for a week and it's parked in a garage so it's definitely not due to wear and tear.I took it into a Toyota service center today and they said this is the first time they've heard of this complaint. The technician then showed me the same problem with 2 other relatively new Rav4s and said this could be a manufacturing defect with the latest batch and will lodge a fault with Toyota HQ.The dealer wanted to charge me a service fee to have the wipers properly inspected or replaced which I thought that was quite ridiculous given this is only a 1 week old vehicle.
DeeEsC writes...Is anyone else's front windscreen wipers smearing water on the return stroke?I didn't see it with my RAV4 which I sold in July to upgrade to a Lexus Hybrid.First rain with the Lexus and this issue appeared.

Called a few dealers today in Melbourne, 4-5 month wait on new builds. Disappointing.
Hi thereI have seen on a few different websites, the parts to add TPMS (Tyre Pressure Monitoring System) to our Rav4's.It looks like the module just plugs into a connector in a panel in the boot, and then fully integrates with the pre-existing software to display the tyre pressures on the dash, as if it was from the factory.The module is about $45 and the set of 4 tyre valve sensors is about another $45.  So for about $90 plus the cost of installing the sensors we would have a fully integrated TPMS system, which comes as on option in other countries (but not Australia)Below is a couple of links to the products on aliexpress, but I have seen them elsewhere as wellModulehttps://bit.ly/38MmvBWSensorshttps://bit.ly/3b2ldFThas anybody tried these to see if they work?

DeeEsC writes...s anyone else's front windscreen wipers smearing water on the return stroke?The wiper arm appeared to be the problem with the clamping force not allowing the wiper plastic frame that holds the rubber to slide freely as it travels across the curvature of the screen. My fix was to use an old wiper arm with another set of new wiper blades as the one that came on the car was also causing issues with not taking the water off the glass cleanlyI also had serious water spots throughout the exterior and interior glass.Btw, tell Toyota to go get f���ed to charge you to fix a wiper.Speaking of wipers, I feel the wiper speed is too slow compared my other cars. At the fastest setting, it���s about the speed I expect for a normal wipe.

So for about $90 plus the cost of installing the sensors we would have a fully integrated TPMS system, which comes as on option in other countries (but not Australia)The main question is whether the only difference between our Australian RAV4 and the US ones is the presence of the TPMS sensor on the wheels and nothing else is needed to be done to integrate those sensors apart from purchasing the aftermarket TPMS module.To answer your question, I have not seen anyone attempt to do this mod so far.

Really suprised to hear about the wiper issue. Are many owners facing this issue too? Seeing out the windscreen is pretty fundamental to safe driving makes a mockery of the safety equipment if the windscreen wipers are ineffective.I'm starting to regret putting my order in, it seems toyota has really dropped the ball. Compared to the i30 SR the RAV4 is missing quite a few easy additions eg TPMS, folding mirrors, drive modes, etc. Especially at the cruiser end of the range, you would think a lot more competitive features could be added.
D��V�� writes...Are many owners facing this issue too?We haven���t noticed on ours. It hasn���t been out in the rain much (still has under 2000k on it) but the one or two times it has the wipers have been fine.Especially at the cruiser end of the range, you would think a lot more competitive features could be added.As soon as the other manufacturers pull their finger out and get a decent hybrid system happening Toyota will be forced to up their game in that area.
The automotive world has not innovated in the past 10 years. Semi autonomous driving hasn���t arrived (Radar cruise was here in 2009). CarPlay/AA... about freaking time, OE tyres are still the same (I had BS Turanza ER33 on my 10 yo Prius and now they���ve just rebadged it Alenza HL33, same tread pattern, same crappy grip). Airbag count remains the same. All you���re paying for is the 2.5 hybrid (good one at that) and ���New car smell ������Chassis wise, I don���t think the average Joe/Jane really values the refinement that much. I���ve got some quiet buzzing on certain roads which I know I���ll have to locate/fix in a few yrs time and I���ve only done 4000km in 6 mths. Not to mention the water leak from the poor engineering of choosing to use loose plastic clips with thinner than paper rubber basket to stop water getting in (10 holes on the roof) that���s been going around coz it���s not a matter of if but when it will leak onto the curtain airbags.Do I regret buying mine? A bit. But what are my choices? Forester? (Transmission longevity questionable + Thirsty), CX5? (Not big enough, too feminine design), Euro stuff (I swore never to buy another Euro car due to reliability gamble), Lexus (Bad value for money, could go Prado/Fortuner for that money with DPF issue), Outlander/Xtrail (JATCO transmission.. no thanks), CRV? (Oil dilution)In some ways I should have got myself an older FJ Cruiser without any of the fancy knowing they���re rock solid to 400,000km. But who knows what fuel cost in 8-10yrs time to keep that machine rolling.

I'm on the fence between the new tucson and rav as I'm in the market for a new car this year.I'm leaning towards the tucson as the looks and tech is just leaps above the rav, that I can take the worse engine option.
Shadovv writes...I'm leaning towards the tucson as the looks and tech is just leaps above the rav, that I can take the worse engine option.Would be interesting to see if all of the features available on the overseas models are carried over to the Australian model of the Tucson. The Australian RAV4 lost a lot of features available in overseas models such as kick to open tailgate, digital rear view mirror, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, etc.Based on what has been revealed so far I would also have picked the Tucson over the RAV4 if the prices are comparable regardless of the drivetrain option. As it stands, I'm content with the RAV4, but I'm not completely satisfied with its interior and missing features for sure.
muramura writes...Not even comparable, Hyundai's one is pretty shit.Mind if you elaborate? I don't know much about hybrid drivetrains and was seriously considering the tucson hybrid if it comes here. Reviews out of Korea where it's already been released are pretty good but probably biased.

I���m not sure if that���s even been solved reading the Rav4world forum.Agree on losing a lot of gear. I came from a 09 Prius that had a lot of ���advanced��� gear which 11 years on, only become mainstream so all I���ve gained is all-speed cruise control. I had radar cruise, pre-crash auto brake system, pre-crash seat belt pre-tensioners, self reverse parking.6 months on, I���m still coming to terms particularly of losing HUD after 10 years with it. Gear lever also is a learning curve getting used to a PRND setup. The Prius setup is more user friendly (Don't have to press P when I switch off the car) but just like the Prius C, it is there to not ���scare��� first time hybrid buyers. Flip side is that it pi22es off existing ones upgrading. Waiting for a Japanese aftermarket solution.The other thing having lived with it for this time is that the hybrid battery cooling fan (like the Prius) doesn���t kick in sufficiently to cool it down. They say it runs best at 36-37C. Once it gets to 44C, any acceleration is done by the ICE to protect the HV battery but I don���t ever hear the fan spool up sucking in air at any urgent rate. Heat is the biggest killer of the HV battery. The only way to cool it down effectively is to drive at a constant pace to reduce the load on the HV battery for 10mins and it might drop a degree or two. There���s no Scangauge command that can force the fan into fast like the Prius. (I need to learn how to make the commands coz there���s not a technical group of enthusiast unlike the Prius people)I could go full nerd on the HV system and what to look out for but it���s supposed to be an all managed eco system. 11 years on, it hasn���t changed the way it manages the health any differently than my Prius.

They are changing the way driving can be in the future particularly taking out the boring bits about driving of autonomous driving on the freeway part. For now I can use the half full water bottle trick shoved on the spokes of the steering wheel and the RAV4 can sort self drive on the freeway.The other problem with Toyota et al is that the ergonomics just plain sucks. If I go from a Yaris, graduate to a Corolla and upwards, the way I say use the cruise control differs. I don���t go from an iPhone X and graduate to a 12 to use the phone any differently.

There���s a lot of infuriating stuff that could so easily be fixed with software updates (a la Tesla)But you know that will never happen with current car makers...
lazydesi writes...can you please elaborate on this trick?similar to this?Yes. Thin neck bottle fit better between the steering wheel spokes and only works on very gentle curves and straights. Also be always alert to take over so you don���t hurt yourself or other fellow road users. Also don���t do it past the mobile phone cameras. Who knows what the computer AI will think you���re doing.
Agree with some of your comments SmellyTofu, I���ve got a cruiser 2WD and find my wife���s Mazda CX-5 is more comfortable. Power wise not that great compared to the Rav 4. Actually thinking about selling my the Rav 4 and getting a smaller daily driver. Toyota really need to lift there game with the quality of the camera and centre screen, I���ve looked at replacing these but not sure it���s worth spending money on this items when a new car of this era should have better.Thinking of getting a VW golf but never had a euro car before, not much else I like on the market.

Based on these figures, the Tucson still somehow appears to have more grunt. That's certainly what the video reviews out of Korea are also demonstrating.Here's an in-depth comparison between the two from a Korean source: https://youtu.be/W4prqioR-RAShe talks about the drive quality around 14 mins into the video. Here, the Tucson is doing much better than the Rav4.Toyota hybrid  technology   Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) is in the market since 1997.Hyundai hybrid technology is new to the market and Tucson  is the gen 1 product using that technology.Yes that's true. One would expect better reliability from the Toyota. I suppose the question for many would be, is the increased reliability worth all the other trade offs? Would the perks of the Tucson be enough to potentially beta-test a new technology.This entire discussion may be moot if Hyundai decides not to bring the hybrid here though.
pacman99 writes...This entire discussion may be moot if Hyundai decides not to bring the hybrid here though.Given that the Santa Fe hybrid is coming this year and the popularity of the RAV4 hybrid, it's highly likely that the Tucson will have a hybrid option.

Don���t do it. The Toyota may be uninspiring but you will save a fortune compared with the VWYeah I���ve read some bad things about VW, are they reliable? And advice is stay away?
It���s only until recently Honda have their hybrids reliability sorted. It will take a decade for any of the euros to sort out their hybrids for fuel efficiency and reliability.Toyota has been at this for 20 years.
abr126 writes...read some bad things about VW, are they reliable?There's plenty on the road
There's plenty on the roadAgree, see heaps on the road. Heaps of negative and positive things about them so it���s hard to decide. I guess Toyota has the best reliability
For every bad experience, there���s always someone willing to pipe up and defend the brand. For so long, I still can���t trust their DSG. My in laws had thousands of $ repairing a clutch shudder noticed by me coz the car would shift into 2nd way too early. Manual shift up a tad later and it would run fine. Car was off the road for weeks. Lucky it was covered by warranty.In my experience, if you get the right Toyota product and know the ins and outs of what to do and no do, it���s treat you right.

I���d wait for the Golf MK8 will be a stunning car, great economy and technology and should be a lot cheaper than the RAV4 if you want to save some money
Thanks all on feedback on VW, I was looking at the golf R so complete opposite of the Rav4 I have now. They say as they have the wet clutch DSG they are better but I don���t know too much about them. Again when I read the reviews there are positive and negative comments, plus the maintenance would be a lot compared to the Toyota.Even though I���m frustrated with a few of the things on the Rav, mainly the tech with regards to the rear camera and centre screen I���m sure I can change these to get better results. The hybrid system is hard to bear though for daily driving.
pacman99 writes...Mind if you elaborate? I don't know much about hybrid drivetrains and was seriously considering the tucson hybrid if it comes here. Reviews out of Korea where it's already been released are pretty good but probably biased.Gladly. The hybrid system in the Tucson was superseded 23 years ago when Toyota released their hybrid system. Hyundai use a regular 6 speed auto transmission in conjunction with a 44kw electric motor that is sandwiched between the ICE engine and the transmission. Regular autos are inefficient and have a limited lifespan, as well as needing to constantly change gears. This also forces the ICE to operate in an inefficient RPM range, and also limits the usefulness of the electric motor.Toyota's hybrid system uses a planetary gearset in conjunction with 2 electric motors, or in the case of the AWD model 3 motors. The big motor has 88kw allowing for much greater electric assist. The planetary gearset is close to 100% efficient during operation and never needs to 'change gear' due to the way it works which allows the engine to run at very low RPM, improving efficiency. It (and the rest of the car) has been proven to travel extreme mileage without failure over the 15 million+ hybrids Toyota have sold since 1997, many in taxi and rideshare service.Long story short, if you buy a Hyundai hybrid, you're buying very old, inefficient and long superseded tech that Hyundai are only using because they don't want to license the far superior Toyota system like Honda, Mazda and Ford have done.
Does anyone have any experience with a new RAV4 and boot space for a pram and a dog?Long story short, Mrs and I are expecting our first child. We currently have a Honda Jazz so looking for something a bit bigger. We tried a car seat on passengers side and pram in the boot, but it was VERY squeezy. I am also 6ft 4 so trying to sit in the front passengers seat involved my knees in my face.We also have a dog (labrador) so looking to be able to fit everythign in. Ideally,- pram in the boot (Looking at a Nuna Triv)- dog in the boot - baby in car seat- me in passengers seatWe test drove a rav and I really liked itIs the Rav4 not the right car for this? Should we be looking at a Kluger/Cx9 if we want to achieve something like this?I honestly dont think we would be taking the dog and the baby many places at the same time, but I would like the option
liu-zhen writes...Should we be looking at a Kluger/Cx9I really don���t think you need that size vehicle until you���re up to 3 kidsSure you get oodles more space, but the CX-9 felt much more boat like to me, with a crap turning circle, harder to manouevre around car parks etcThe RAV4 had the best boot space for a more car-like drive.If you���ve got deep pockets for servicing and maintenance costs, the wagon Passat/Golf or Skoda equivalents actually have much bigger boots and are so much more sensible in terms of usable, practical space for prams, groceries, holiday luggage...
liu-zhen writes...Does anyone have any experience with a new RAV4 and boot space for a pram and a dog?We have a 4 month old and two samoyeds. Our pram is an Uppababy Alta. We can't fit the pram and the dogs in the back, as there's not enough room for both the dogs to move around and get comfortable for the ride. It's doable with one dog though :)You could also flip down one of the rear seats for more room for the pram and your dog, while still having your baby capsule\seat in the other rear seat. We can't do this as we have a cargo barrier installed.Oh I'm 170 cm and I can fit ok in the front passenger seat in front of the baby capsule (Maxi-cosi AP). Although, I had to move the passenger seat is further forward that I would like, there's still room in front of my knees.

The cover can be flipped over for the carpeted side which might give the dogs a little more grip when in the back.We got the rubber cargo mat, it's pretty grippy for the dogs when they're in the back so they don't slide around.
My previous car was 10 year old Forester base model.. no reverse cameras or other fancy gadgets. So, i can't really complain with all the new features at this stage. Loving the 360 degree or skyview camera... makes parking so much easier. Some of my gripes so far:1. What really annoys me for a $50K car is that, it doesn't have illumination on all the switches and buttons on the drivers door. Can't believe Toyota cheaped out on that. I find it really inconvenient, and will be swapping that module out soon.2. The other annoyance is the auto fold side mirror, which most knows about already. Once again, aftermarket job to get that fixed.3. Non LED internal lighting, indicator and reverse lights. The internal and reverse lights are very dull.4. Non electric passenger seat adjustment.5. Ventilates seats would have been handy in summer.6. Wireless charger can be hit and miss when trying to charge a phone.7. Only one USB port for infotainment system. As i am a regular user of Android Auto, my phone is always plugged in to USB port. To listen to music from a separate USB device, it needs to use the same USB port. It will not work on any other USB ports. Yes, i could have the music stored in the phone, but would like the option of having another USB device plugged in almost permanently as another source for audio. I think i saw a post where someone is using a USB hub.. might have to look into this.8. The school zone warning, on non school times. If i could get rid of this, but keep the other warnings. I like the speed camera and don't mind the speed limit warnings. Only if i can get the Toyota navigation map updated... as there is a new speed camera in my area, that is not on the map. You know it is there... but there are times you simply forget about it.Apart from these, i really like the smoothness of the drive of the car. It can get little noisy on a climb when engine is made to work, but then again my old forester sounded like a tank.Someone mentioned about disappointment about the OEM tyres on the car. I dont know if it is the car in general, or the tyre has something to do with it, but i find the ride very smooth and very impressed with it.DM

Mmcrhttps://youtu.be/nxxC1z0RELMThis youtube clip shows how its done.Looks pretty simple actually. Easier than installing the auto fold mirror module. The hardest part is sourcing the actual part. The Americans been doing this using Camry/Corolla/Chr part. It appears they will work. They are buying it new from US websites.. and AliExpress. Unfortunately these are all for LHD. You could try contacting the auto salavage yards for the part you need. Would have to be a fairly recent model that's been written off. Don't know what the cost of the new module would be.. haven't asked the dealer yet.. assume will go into hundreds.I bought mine off ebay.. from europe. Part is from CHR. However i am taking a bit of a gamble on this, as the part number im getting is not one of the part that has been verified to work. Someone tried a part from Lexus. Fits fine.. but didn't work. Anyway.. we shall see when the part arrives. Will report back on result.

I just need to pull my finger out to wire it up. Then I can toss the unit installed now in the bin.For me, I have a narrow double garage, I need all the space I need to park close to one side so I can open my drivers door.

Hyundai are not going to drop a dud engine into a 2021 model revamp.First, if the 'actual' fuel consumption figures are close, not the government tested figures, sure, you've got a point. Toyota hybrids basically always come remarkably close to achieving their tested figures in the real world, whereas other vehicles test figures are generally fantasy numbers. We don't know how the Hyundai hybrids perform yet though, we'll have to wait for professional and owner reviews to get a clear picture of the economy numbers, unless you want to be their guinea pig.Secondly, if you buy the Hyundai, you're also the guinea pig for Hyundai's hybrid reliability. They don't have the proven history of the Toyota system. Are their HV batteries reliable? How long do they last? What about the inverters? The electric motor? Is the HV cabling properly sized? There are a lot more things to go wrong on a hybrid, and only Toyota have proven they can do it right so far ��� even Honda couldn't get it right and ended up using Toyota's design. Dunno about you, but if I'm handing over $50k for a new car, I want something that millions of other people have test driven before me.Third, Hyundai have a recent history of doing the very thing you have trust that they won't do:https://thelemonfirm.com/2019/11/26/hyundai-and-kias-theta-ii-engines-manufacturing-defects-recalls-and-spontaneous-fires-are-just-the-beginning/https://www.autoblog.com/2020/12/04/hyundai-engine-recall/A basic, bog standard naturally aspirated 4 cly engine fitted to millions of cars (including the Sonata hybrid) had manufacturing defects that caused complete failure shortly outside of warranty, and Hyundai tried to wash their hands of it until the law got involved. I'll let you draw your own conclusions there.Toyota have their problems (diesel particulate filters) and are even going down the same route as Hyundai with trying to shirk their obligations to customers there, but their hybrids at least are solid.

Adding the module for auto closing mirrors requires removing the door trim for example.  If anything goes wrong behind the door trim from that point forward, the dealer may, at their discretion refuse to honor anything warranty related.But for example if you modify behind the door trim and something goes wrong with the seat, then the seat warranty should be fine.
Hi, new to this forum. Looking for pricing on a red 2021 GX 2WD Hybrid in Brisbane. Any recent prices?
Are the 2021 models actually released yet ??I mean we are only in january....compliance plates surely wont be saying jan 2021
Apparently the 2021 models are arriving in March.
My guess is that any factory orders from now will be 2021 complianced

Anyone purchased the Rav 4 with Toyota staff discount and managed to negotiate the costs of extras?We are buying using our cousin's 15% staff discount but the dealer wont budge on the cost of extras. Just wondering whether every dealer will be the same or is it worth shopping around.We just want the side steps, tow bar, all weather cargo mats and floor mats, nudge bar, tinted windows and possible dash cam.Im in Victoria

chilwah writes...We just want the side steps, tow bar, all weather cargo mats and floor mats, nudge bar, tinted windows and possible dash cam.Don't forget to add the  Tow Ball and Trailer Wiring Harness.
PinzVidz writes...The employee discount is subsidised by TMC/TMCA for the vehicle itself, not for accessories.Pity the cousin can���t buy the accessories at staff price given it���s not registered to the cousins name.I���d walk to another dealership if they won���t do discounts on accessories. Otherwise things like mats (eBay.. pretty much trade price) and tint (save you 50% going outside). You���re not forced to buy from there.
Tints and dashcam and usually handled by the after sales department. They���ll quote you some insane amount and then ���generously��� offer you a discount on the original quote (which is still way more expensive than doing it yourself). Just do these yourself if your primary goal is saving money.Floor mats are standard as of Aug 2020 builds, but even before then most dealers would (should) have thrown them in for free.
Rubber mats aren���t standard. I also never got any accessories ���thrown��� in on my deal. $88 for rubber mats. Had to buy a towbar+wiring+ball from eBay (looked to be retail price) fitted it myself.Plus if you buy accessories on a new car, you pay additional stamp duty on them. Take the car, install them at the 1mth ���free��� servicing���.
Thanks guys, looks like its best to just buy the car first then install the rest later.Never expected these extras free with the staff discount but was hoping to not pay rrp. Never got a brand new car before but mainly want the side steps for the kids and tow bar for the bike rack.
The side steps will be a pain for adults and become a flimsy rock slider coz it reduces the ramp over angles. There are aftermarket step alternatives if you really need one. My little one isn���t too short (135cm) and is ok getting in himself.Towbar, you have 2 choices. OE or Hayman Reese. The HR one does not require you to remove the rear bumper beam. Downside is that the hitch is maybe 5cm lower than the OE which may matter to you if you drive over sharp angle ground. Both will require bumper cutting. Price is the same on eBay. $684 for the lot (not fitted)OE has a cutting template and is located higher to not impact departure angle and will require you to remove the rear crash beam (can���t modify to fit even just a tiny bit). Price about mid $800���s (not fitted)Both trailer wiring should be similar. Lumen makes the wiring harness for OE and HR. Since all RAV4 are pre-wired for trailer lights, fitment is a piece of cake. Same for towbar. Some tutorial on YouTube of the US guys fitting theIr OE which is based off the same design.
The RAV4 made up 4.2% of new car sales last year while pure EVs were only 0.2% and just a tad better than plug-in hybrid sales below that-https://www.msn.com/en-au/money/news/green-shoots-after-covid-19-hit-car-market/ar-BB1cvqv0
Thinking of buying the genuine bonnet protector for our RAV4, any one now how difficult it is to DIY install?Tried looking for instructions or tutorials online but coming up with nothing unfortunately.
D3lusion writes...how difficult it is to DIY install?relatively straight forward solo, but easier with a helper to hold things.. clean paint. mark out where to stick 6 protective plastic tabs (the only tricky part).. fit the centre two mounting brackets (screwed). fit the 4 outer mounting brackets (push on).. it may appear to 'sit above' the bonnet when  fitted as it doesn't wrap around/under bonnet.. Spread a cover over the engine to catch any screws or washers you may drop as you won't find them.
Thanks Smellytofu thats really helpful.Very excited, my first SUV and brand new car.
D3lusion writes...Tried looking for instructions or tutorials online but coming up with nothing unfortunately.Most covered above but I���d only add that the metal clips you push over the protective tape is mega tight and I added more protective tape (cheap by the roll on Aliexpress) on the underside of the bonnet to allow me to use a metal trim removal tool to pry out the clip to be able to push the clips into position.Also take your time. Line up and add the protective first with the bare bonnet protector without the 2 centre clips coz once those 2 centre clips are in, they ain���t coming out.Here���s a Japanese tutorial on fitting the Australian ���bug guard���https://youtu.be/I6wNhqhX0T4

How is the built-in Nav system? Probably gonna use Android Auto for navigation. Wondering if it's worth the extra $1k.
R2G writes...How is the built-in Nav system? Probably gonna use Android Auto for navigation. Wondering if it's worth the extra $1k.We have the Cruiser and have never bothered using the integrated Sat Nav. IMO, save the extra 1k and use either Google Map or Waze via Android Auto.
I wouldn���t use it even if it was free, let alone paying $1k for it.
R2G writes...How is the built-in Nav system? Probably gonna use Android Auto for navigation. Wondering if it's worth the extra $1k.krap, that is one of the reason I went with with out sat nav model.
Does the built-in sat nav integrate with the Multi-function display? And do you get speeding/school zone/speed camera warnings even if the map isn't open on the main screen?
I wouldn't heavily rely on the integrated nav ��� it does not understand one-way streets (so frustrating).
SmellyTofu writes...The side steps will be a pain for adults and become a flimsy rock slider coz it reduces the ramp over angles. There are aftermarket step alternatives if you really need one.Can you elaborate on this? I have a 4 year old and 4 month old and was planning to order the RAV4 in a few weeks with the side steps. Had a look in person and they seemed stylish and practical enough, but didn't have the toddler with me to check if he could climb in by himself without them.
The side steps for me anyway does not come out far enough for my feet to be useful. Shoe size may vary the experience (I���m only a short size 7.5)With the flimsy rock slider comment, the step comes down too low so the lowest contact point in an over ramp situation will be the side steps and that is held in by 7 clips on each side that will bend upwards and into your doors.4 yr old might be tough to get in but honestly do you want a 4yo to be in control of an opening door and expect them to not hit anything (incl parked car or worse, oncoming traffic)I���d say buy the car without it, get the lowest price possible (nothing is thrown in for free), live with it for a month and then if you really must, fit them at the 1 mth mark.
R2G writes...you get speeding/school zone/speed camera warnings even if the map isn't open on the main screen?You get all those regardless of what is open on the main screen (including when using CarPlay etc for nav)I've ended up turning them all off ��� the school zones in particular are annoying because they alert outside of school hours as well
What is the best format for playing music? Anyone tried mp3s on usb sticks or are there better methods, would it take a portable harddrive?I have a ton of music for the kids on cds so its essential they get their regular tunes otherwise all hell will break loose.
Hi All,I was looking to buy a RAV4 Hybrid so found this forum but decided against the extra cost but I just saw this Video about a Moose Test fail by the RAV4 in 2019 which Toyota then made a software update to the Vehicle Stability Control which makes it a lot safer but sadly Toyota won���t have the update in production for maybe years so to get this increased safety feature apparently you need to request your Toyota dealer makes this update at your next service. Watch this YouTube for details: https://youtu.be/xSRCJFCmvTk
D��V�� writes...What is the best format for playing music? Anyone tried mp3s on usb sticks or are there better methods, would it take a portable harddrive?Yes.. mp3 on usb stick will work but only from the usb port from the front console. Unfortunately there is only one port there.. that is the only port that supports mp3 playback and Android auto or Apple carplay. One option is to have all mp3 on your phone.

WindDrifter writes...Moose Test failI���m pretty sure that was only for the plug-in hybrid which doesn���t apply here is Australia.
Put some Pilot Sport 4 tyres on it. It���s fly through that with ease. I honestly don���t want the software as I want the car to rotate a bit when I do end up with new stickier tyres.
Another option is that if you have an no longer used smartphone you could fill up the songs there and play it through Bluetooth.
After 4 months of ownership I have ended up liking the RAV4 Cruiser more than I thought I would....Not so good and these are pretty minor
The engine can be a bit intrusive given the quietness of MG2 and MGR. CVT isn���t the culprit coz it holds the revs low for as long as possible before you give it the beans.

SmellyTofu writes...4 yr old might be tough to get in but honestly do you want a 4yo to be in control of an opening door and expect them to not hit anything (incl parked car or worse, oncoming traffic)I have a 4 and 6 years old. Kids are neither strong enough nor allowed to open the door and I make it a point to open the ���kerb side door��� for them and they love to step in themselves and then climb into their child seats as well like small adults. The 4 year old needs a hand getting into the child seat but as he is growing taller he insists on doing everything himself other than buckling him up. IMO they are a must for a young family as I think without them I would definitely be lifting the 4 year old into the seat. The steps look concealed with the doors closed and when the doors are open they are easy to use. Wouldn���t have the car without them.
razmataz writes...IMO they are a must for a young family as I think without them I would definitely be lifting the 4 year old into the seat.Thanks for that feedback. I'm the same ��� we open the door for him and he climbs into the seat while we sort the baby. Will be getting 2WD anyway, so minimal risk of rocks or ramps hitting the underside of the sidesteps and what not.

uggugg writes...Another option is that if you have an no longer used smartphone you could fill up the songs there and play it through Bluetooth.That has an obvious downside of using up the car Bluetooth channel for music playback only, so it is no longer available for hands free calls via your own phone. From that viewpoint, USB stick playback looks preferable, especially if kids want to manage their own playlists and you don't want to give them your phone. And muting the music during the call is also going to be done properly. Officeworks sells 32GB sticks for $4. More than enough to fit the entire kids MP3 music collection.

I'm looking to make a purchase on a new car in the next few months. I have been holding off due to Covid then thought I would wait until the new Outback model comes out. As my shortlist is Forester, Outback  and Rav4. Currently Rav 4 is my third choice, but decision is far from made as there are some aspects I really like about it.A quick question for existing Rav 4 owners, what is the head room like in the rear seats? That is, I have a son that is 6 foot 1 (and is 14 so still got lots of growing left in him). Can anyone that currently owns a late model Rav 4, and is of this height, confirm what it is like sitting in the rear? Enough room to sit ok? In the rear of my current Kia Sportage he has to lean to the side, and that gets understandably uncomfortable for him. So I'm loathe to spend time looking at a car with this problem still, if it has...

My biggest issue with the 2.5L engine in the Forester is it feels rather lethargic compared to the Hybrid  in the RAV4.

I've taken plenty of calls which interrupts their music.  I'm using Android, not sure if that would make a difference or not.You might be right ��� it never occurred to me as I am always in the car by myself. I have just checked the "Navigation_and_MMedia_Manual_RAV4_2019.pdf", and it is somewhat vague as to the subject of possibility of simultaneous connection of the multiple BT devices. That's what is says on page 42: ---Quote begins---Up to 5 Bluetooth devices can be registered.Bluetooth compatible phones (HFP) and audio players (AVP) can be registered simultaneously---Quote ends---Not sure if the last sentence there actually rather means "can be CONNECTED simultaneously" ��� it probably does, going by what you wrote.  So, to me it appears that you can have one BT device connected for the calls and one BT device connected at the same time for audio playing.  Not two phones, not two audios, just one each.Thanks for pointing that out.
digital_silence writes...Not two phones, not two audios, just one eachThis is what happens in my car, I guess by default.  When it's just me, I'll likely podcast through AndroidAuto.  Note that if you use AA or ACP, this disconnects all Bluetooth connections.    Nothing else will connect.  You'll see in the menu that Bluetooth isn't a selectable option if you're using the connection under the head unit in front of the wireless charging.  That is if you have AA or ACP installed on your mobile with auto connect etc.I usually move the charging point to the center armrest console (where there's 2) as you have to use the one directly under the head unit only for AA or ACP.   This way, Bluetooth is fine and I can connect normally and the kids (once they've finished arguing over who is going to stream) can do their thing.
Having read all that, it sounds like it's not possible to use Apple CarPlay to connect to my iPhone to use Google Maps for navigation and have a passenger's phone connect via Bluetooth to play their music?

Hi folksHoping you can put my mind at ease.I'm 6"5. My partner and I test drove both the Hybrid Cruiser and GXL.

Put it this way, the way the holes are plugged in the Australian ones are the same as the ones used in the US/Japan/Taiwan. There are 5 holes each side "sealed" with plastic plugs with <0.2mm thick rubber gaskets and those plugs are able to move from side to side. It might not be an issue now but I'd dare say it'd be an issue maybe just as the warranty is up given these rubber gaskets are so paper thin.
Rendog writes...https://youtu.be/Vdjb8CrAA6wThat was a real interesting vid. I doubt I would be doing anything harder than that, but possibly might still need the higher ground clearance. But it seems there is very little difference between them: 0.3 inches between Rav 4 and the Subies, so not enough to really make a meaningful difference...The vid certainly shows the Rav 4 (hybrid at least) has a lot better off road capability than I had given it credit for.

Would there be any side affects of having the batteries under the back seats? This is where the kids will be, apparently there are vents on the seats, should these not vent to outside? Im feeling a bit concerned about batteries right under them.

Maybe you could call them and ask if they will arrange transport to VIC if you buy from them? Can't imagine transport costing more than say $500.
Yeh i paid 47 with metallic paint, ordered august, delivered december.

51.5k for cruiser AWD in WA with metallic paint, dashcam and window tinting
Had a test drive in Brisbane today and been offered 48k for rav4 hybrid cruiser awd with basic white color.
Hi puff, do you mind to share which dealer? I've been offered 48k but basic white. floor mats are standard i think unless you have rubber mats?

Interesting findings from my question about passenger height a couple of pages back. I posted the question that my over six foot son being able to sit in the Rav 4. We went into the closest dealer today. In the rear seat there was really good clearance. But when he sat in the front passenger seat there was only about a couple of cm clearance. Unfortunately the front passenger seat can't be adjusted up and down. We moved it around....Sat in the GLX and Cruiser and both were the same. Even though the GLX does not have sun roof, there is still a dip and slope to it. So any bump we go over, he'll be hitting his head...Or only ever sitting in the back seat...which will p!$$ him off no end...We were surprised as generally find the front seat usually has higher head space than the rear...So RAV4 is off the list for me...A shame...But I can't have a car that will put my son in a bad mood....
Make him wear a helmet

Ordered a Cruiser Hybrid AWD on Saturday. Spoke to the dealer on Wednesday, and it's currently sitting as an unconfirmed March build (to be confirmed mid-February).Dealer seems to think if not a March build, almost certain to be an April build (May delivery). Which is in line with the 3-4 months quoted by a few dealers.

Which is in line with the 3-4 months quoted by a few dealers.Be sceptical of what the dealer is telling you. They cannot guarantee anything until the order goes through and is accepted by Toyota for a specific build date. Join the Facebook group "Australians waiting for 2020 RAV4s" and you'll see recent examples of people who have had their quoted date by the dealer get continually pushed back because of the ordering system. Not completely the dealer's fault as it is out of their hands, but just don't believe everything they say.There is a website where you can track your order, ask your dealer for the details so you can follow it yourself.
Melbourne today. Was quoted $52,000 drive away with rubber boot mat, full tank. 3 ��� 4 month wait. Asked if that was their best price and they said yes.Has anyone tried motorscout.com.au to try and get a decent price?

Spoke to the dealer on Wednesday, and it's currently sitting as an unconfirmed March build (to be confirmed mid-February).So I ordered the same but with the notorious Nutmeg interior back on September (apparently there are less production slots for Nutmeg, delaying build date). Mine was built in November, delivered end of December.So 2 months between order to build sounds about right.
Hi all, for those who has installed Blackuve dash cam in your RAV4, could you recommend:- use power magic or battery pack?- if battery pack, did you installed close to the driver seat or in the boot?- does the 12v socket on after you turn off the engine?Thks.
Clerth writes...- use power magic or battery pack?- if battery pack, did you installed close to the driver seat or in the boot?- does the 12v socket on after you turn off the engine?I've got a Blackvue DR-900S-2Ch and had it installed with the power magic pro. I found that it eventually ran down the 12v battery so there was no parking mode time at all, the camera would only come on when driving. Driving  for a while would charge up the 12v battery again, but always ended up running it down again as the driving wasn't enough.I swapped to the B124X battery instead, wired to the fuse box. The battery only charges when the car is running, will get around 14-15hours of parking time with a 100% battery. Because I used a fuse tap, it charges faster than via the12v socket.That's what I would recommend. I mounted mine under the where the wireless charger is in the centre console.There's a large enough area that fits the B124X perfectly. I wrapped it in a non-slip rubber mat (like you use in drawers) to stop it rattling around and it is fine.

The parking mode for BlackVue has been a big disappointment for me. It is not working as i was hoping  it would.Have the DR750x-2ch, and detection sensors are far too sensitive. Even with the lowest setting of "1", it continually triggers detection.. and basically records every minute. Tree leaves moving... people walking by, cars going by... lighting change... you name it... all gets picked up and triggers detection. I tried to configure the zone settings as well... to use only 1 row of blocks... slightly better... but still fair amount of false detections. I have given up for now.. and just let it falsely detect all it likes until the battery goes flat. I have turned off motion detection notification... was driving me nuts on the phone... i have mine configured to cloud at home, as the parked car can reach my wifi signal at home.I guess the other option is to simply disable motion detection in parking mode, and rely on impact detection to do its thing. However, this will only trigger if your car gets hit while parked or a trolley thumps into your car with some force in shopping center car park. Opening and closing your doors while parked triggers this detection too.Enjoy!!

FennAU writes...Anyone else still waiting on their car?I ordered mine at the end of October and it still hasn't been built!We ordered ours on December 1st via Maxxia novated lease through CMI Toyota. I was told approx. 3 months by Maxxia. Then when it came to speaking to the Dealer, I was told 6 months. I asked what could be done about the wait time because I was thinking of pulling the pin. He checked with the stock controller and explained that certain Dealerships have over-allocation ordered for them sometimes, and that he would check for our colour and model (plain white Hybrid Cruiser) for any over-allocated stock.He found one for us. It was built on 24th Dec and is expected to arrive at the Dealership on Feb 17th.

Does the cargo barrier reduce the visibility out the back by much? Has anyone got a good deal on the seat covers?
Is there any noticeable difference between the Cruiser 2020 and 2021 version?What's the best deals out there at the moment? We're looking at eclectic blue ��� the local dealer website says it's a touch over $48k for that.

You could probably get the 2WD for ~$45k.Auto folding mirrors should have been in place from day 1.  In terms of range cars locally available your right stock is way down there are 28 cruisers of which 8 are hybrids across Australia according to carsales. This is slim pickings, at the back end of August 2020 I had a choice in NSW of a dozen cruisers in 2wd and 4wd on the lot at that time.
D��V�� writes...Does the cargo barrier reduce the visibility out the back by much?We've got the metal cargo barrier installed and I don't think it reduces the visibility out the back by much. The metal mesh part of the barrier is quite thin, only the edge and a bit in the middle (below the back of the rear seats) is thick. When I'm using the rear view mirror, I'm looking at an object in the distance so I actually don't really notice it.
Well...my family and I were in a large car accident (luckily no-one was badly hurt), but it seems the current car will be a write-off. Dilemma time...no idea how I can realistically purchase a new Rav4 if the wait time is 3-6 months. What would you do in the meantime?
If you really want/need a car now, ring around dealers and ask if they have any cancelled orders. But be prepared to pay more and also possibly compromise on colourThat is what I did when I bought at end of Dec 2020 and managed to get a 2WD Cruiser Hybrid. Same dealer had two other AWD Cruiser Hybrids that were cancelled orders at the same time too. Needed the car now and didnt want to wait 4-6 months with no certainty on the delivery date.
LusDekkar writes...cargo barrier installed and I don't think it reduces the visibility out the back by much.Thanks, do you know if you can still access the child seat tether points on the back of the seats. Looking at the images online, it doesn't look like you can.
D��V�� writes...do you know if you can still access the child seat tether points on the back of the seats.Yes you can still access the top tether anchor points for a baby capsule\seat at the back of the seats with the cargo barrier installed. You may have to fit the baby seat with the back seat in the up right position. At least that's how the installer left our back seat when they fitted the baby seat. So we currently have the left back seat up right (first click), and the middle and right seats slightly reclined (second click).
Been having 2nd thoughts about getting a new Cruiser only due to price and whether I actually need the extras. Would I have any regrets if I went for a GXL?

D��V�� writes...Never understood the benefit of this one, always found it slower to close then operating it myself. Would be pretty limited in benefit, maybe a parent holding a child a the time or someone very frail.Self closing feature is passed down from luxury cars. It���s about elegance and not having to slam something shut.But the way Toyota have done it is not very elegant. With all the beeping and stupidly slow motors.Also one of the sedans i had, had both self closing and soft close. With soft close there is an actuator that pulls the lid in and locks it when you decide to close it manually. It���s actually very satisfying hearing the motion.
703 writes...4 months vs years of disliking the colour when you have to live with it.There���s a balance to be struck. My preferred colours were Atomic Rush or Saturn Blue and I ended up with Crystal Pearl which was acceptable to me. I would have not taken an Eclectic Blue or Black car.
D��V�� writes...Can you open it from a distance with the remote? My old car had this feature and that would handy when you had your hands full with groceries, etc.How would you open it with the remote if your hands are full? What would have been nice in this situation is if it had the kick gesture to open feature that is on some US models.
skdsh writes...Been having 2nd thoughts about getting a new Cruiser only due to price and whether I actually need the extras.Would I have any regrets if I went for a GXL?It depends on whether you value the extras / the extras are something that you would use, how long you plan to keep the car for, and whether the $3,700ish difference between the GXL and the Cruiser pushes the car above your budget.In my opinion you get a lot of inclusion for the difference in price if those inclusions are useful for you. In my case I did want the features such as the moon roof, panoramic view monitor, 7 inch multi information display, electric seats, etc so I went for the Cruiser. The soft touch material in the Cruiser is also much nicer than the hard plastic in the GX and GXL even if it's not real leather.D��V�� writes...Can you open it from a distance with the remote?You can open the tailgate using the remote.

Hi thereJust ordered our AWD cruiser. Looking at options to replace the space saver spare.Genuine Toyota matching rim was 900 from the dealer, seems a bit excessiveHas anyone sourced another cheaper brand? If it���s the same dimensions just a different style would that be ok?
Only the GX has the option of a full size spare but others have posted videos of replacing the space saver from overseas. What i was wondering will anything bigger than the 17inch tyre fit in the boot space?
TomFoolery writes...Has anyone sourced another cheaper brand? If it���s the same dimensions just a different style would that be ok?Went to Bob Jane and they quoted me $400 for wheel and tyre. Didn't see what wheel that was, but as it would only be a spare didn't really care. Would only leave it in car if I was doing a country trip.
D��V�� writes...What i was wondering will anything bigger than the 17inch tyre fit in the boot space?A lot of people have replaced their space saver with a full size spare. It fits perfectly and the boot floor sits flush on the higher position as long as the foam pad on the bottom of the spare tyre well is removed.
A full size spare fits in the Cruiser boot but you won't be able to utilise the extra drop space below it with the adjustable/removable floor.If you are after a full size spare, check the 2021 Toyota RAV4 Australia Facebook group. Once in a while someone will be selling their original tires after replacing with aftermarkets. Prices I've seen are around $400 or so
Unfortunately, I only was told the expected date of delivery which was meant to be 28 Jan.
TomFoolery, your price was much better than the quote of $2200 (with tyre) I got from the dealer! Admittedly, I requested the price after accepting the order foolishly thinking they would look after me, but it wasn't to be.I will keep an eye on the facebook group as well, but if anyone on here (in WA) decides to change the wheels on their cruiser hybrid, please let me know!

Just picked up my RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser yesterday in Graphite. Very happy with the car in general. The ride is good and I like the smooth acceleration. It's got good room inside for a family of 4.A few things that are bugging me however and haven't been able to solve them myself.First issue is the school zone warning its very annoying. There are schools everywhere and it warns me even on Saturday! How do I disable it? I tried looking for the option in detail navigation settings but there is no school zone option for me.Second issue is the powered tailgate makes a loud beeping sound when it opens and closes. Its the same sound a big truck would make backing up. Can it be disabled?Third issue at the moment is when I back out of my driveway I need to pass our hedges on the way out which are pretty close to the car. Yes I do get close to the hedges but if I brush them its not an issue but the car starts beeping like made and its really distracting. What I can do here to the avoid the mad beeping?Thanks,Kefa

Its the same sound a big truck would make backing up. Can it be disabled?According to the manual its set for the highest volume by default, but can be changed to a lower volume in the settings (some where...I dont have a powered tailgate...also the manual says that the dealer ...or if you have the techstreame/carista app you can disable the sound all together.)

I tried looking for the option in detail navigation settings but there is no school zone option for me.The school zone info comes from the navigation system and GPS, so you modify settings on the central navigation display.  Menu ��� Setup ��� Navigation (p100 and 103 in Navigation/Multimedia Manual)I initially (8 days ago) found changing speed limit settings very confusing.  I now realise that alerts from the Navigation/GPS are modified on the central Navigation display.  And alerts from reading speed signs in real time are modified on the multi-information display ��� the one in front of you with the speedo.Second issue is the powered tailgate makes a loud beeping sound when it opens and closes. Its the same sound a big truck would make backing up. Can it be disabled?This modified on the multi-information display. p378 in the Owners Manual  and p382 lists what can be changed for power back door.  I have turned my volume down to 1.  You may be able to persuade your dealer to turn off the beeps while the door is moving ��� my understanding is that you can't stop the initial beep.

I have seen the delivery spreadsheet  and I see around 47, 48k is good deal with some extras.Welcome to Whirlpool Whichcar3000I'm not in Melbourne but across the country supply is really constrained with allot of people currently having to wait for 3-4 + months so discounts are not big a couple of thousand unless you find one at a dealership that you can haggle over.Also, I've never used a broker, are they worth it?Sometimes, I have seen people do better than what the broker quoted, call 4-5 dealer and closer to the end of the month might net you a deal if your willing to sign quickly if the price is right.
Can you please share in  which state this price is and  Who is the dealer/ quote from?   (48K Hybrid 4WD cruiser RAV4 )
Is this NSW price and who is the provider of this quote?
Can you please let me know who is the agent?  I too looking  to order RAV4 cruiser, hybrid 2 WD. But all the Toyota dealers quote the standard WEB price of $48 K for metallic colour.

They immediately came back with that price, I signed the contract 10 mins later.The way I see it, orders are cream for the dealer ��� they write the contract, make the order, the car comes in and they deliver it minus their commission. No holding costs to pay for floor stock sitting on the forecourt, plus they get a chance at parts and service for the life of the car, plus the chance of repeat business, plus positive word of mouth ��� I went to that dealer from the recommendation of a work colleague.No idea how you'll go in VIC though, maybe dealer attitudes are different there.
Been combing through the thread but haven���t found any comments around the following, apologies if I missed it (it is a long thread)The battery annual check for hybrids ��� Does this kick in after the capped price servicing period (4 services)? How much does it cost and do you think it is worth it to extend the hybrid battery warranty to 10 years?Servicing after the capped price period for hybrids ��� read somewhere that this gets expensive $800 a service?  If that���s correct It���s something to consider if you are looking at holding the rav for a long time. The perceived hybrid low servicing costs once averaged over a longer (say 10 year period) and including the annual battery check may not be cheaper than some of the non hybrid vehicles it competes against. Admittedly, there is going to be a significant savings in fuel costs over that period v non hybrid competitors.
Williered writes...Servicing after the capped price period for hybrids ��� read somewhere that this gets expensive $800 a service?This varies after the 5 years / 75,000km capped price period.

@mucchan thanks for that info, very helpful. Just trying to get a proper read on the real costs associated with the rav4 hybrid v competitors.If the hybrid battery needs to be replaced around the 10 year mark (estimate) , that may also impact resale value
How much is just the battery "check"? I am sure I am going to DIY from 7th year like I do with my other hybrid. I still don't get what they actually do other than check if a code has been triggered.Btw, the battery won't need replacing at 10 year mark. It really depends on the condition you're using it for (I had my Prius for 11 yrs, still ran strong before I sold it). Although it's an additional gauge with more dedicated equipment, but HV temp plays a part in the longevity. So far I am not happy with the way the battery temp management is implemented with it "overheating" (i.e. >44C) at sedate driving pace where temps were in low 20C. When it does overheat, it doesn't kick the fan at full speed even at 46C and thus intervention to kick up the fan speed is required to drop it back. How you know it's overheated is when you touch the throttle in the slightest, it'd fire up the petrol motor even though you've got good charge.Also if you like to keep the battery for longer, ALWAYS warm up the car regardless of season till the engine cuts out (i.e. engine coolant at 40C).When driving it from dead cold will draw all its motive power from the HV battery and if you left the car at 50% HV charge, it'd go below the 40% limit and go into below operating range (40-80% is normal operating charge range for both NiMH and Li ion). Also note if you've got A/C on whilst warming up, the petrol motor will not supplement the electricity needed to run the A/C and also run below 40% until the engine coolant is at 40C.This post will probably be buried in this deep thread but anyway. If you want to keep the HV battery shiny side up, at the very least, warm up the car before moving. Fortunately the motor warms up quick (faster than the Prius anyway) so you're not waiting around that long.
What do you mean exactly by warming up? Turn it on and let it sit running for X minutes ?
Press the power button, tap the throttle (in Park) quickly which will start the petrol engine. When the petrol motor stops automatically, then it's ready to drive (and coolant at 40C).Obviously this is for all Toyota hybrid. Petrol only models can do whatever they want.

Probably need to email Toyota for that.

Yeah, blame the fact that emissions control systems need a bit of heat and also engine oil needs to circulate. Until we move to pure EV, we're all going to have to deal with it.
SmellyTofu writes...Yeah, blame the fact that emissions control systems need a bit of heat and also engine oil needs to circulate. Until we move to pure EV, we're all going to have to deal with it.So was this an issue in the Prius too ?
Wouldn't call it an issue but more to protect the engine from damage and minimise the time required to warm up the catalytic converter but yeah, it's what I do on the Prius. There's a whole writeup on Priuschat.com site on the warm up sequences (but the site is down right now or else I'd link the thread).(cached version)https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:A7O0hUPzmuYJ:https://priuschat.com/threads/gen3-warming-up-stages.76501/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=jp&client=safari
SmellyTofu writes...When the petrol motor stops automatically, then it's ready to drive (and coolant at 40C)i really can't see that this is necessary. if Toyota thought that this was necessary for battery life, they would have programmed the car to do that automatically each time you start (from cold) before switching to the battery.
Have you seen SoC <30%? I have coz I wanted to see if the system was to save itself. It will never show up on the 8 bar setup so regular users would be oblivious.Anyway, you do what you like with your���s. it���s been my experience over the years of multiple hybrids in my ownership. Is my advice and everyone is welcome to choose
SmellyTofu writes...There's a whole writeup on Priuschat.com site on the warm up sequences (but the site is down right now or else I'd link the thread).I already know that this statement is untrue:"the ignition timing is very late, after the top dead center. therefore the engine does not have enough power to drive Prius or charge battery.basically, Prius can not use the engine power when you drive"He also says this:"this is not a complete list yet and it is based on JP Gen3 Prius, therefore "subject to change" and may not apply other country's Prius"I also have had a ZVW30 Prius for 11 years with the original battery and I know for a fact that basically full engine power is available during the warmup sequence, contrary to the statement made in that post. Ask for significant engine power and you'll get it from dead cold, you can hear the engine RPM rise well above idle, plus there is a whole lot more power available to the wheels than the max 60kW from MG2. I've only seen <40% SOC in the following conditions:Engine dead cold, outside temperature very low.Startup and normal driving until battery drops to roughly 40% SOC, corresponding to 2 out of 8 bars on the battery gauge.Then accelerator flat to the floor, max power ��� battery will dip down to about 30% SOC, then MG2 significantly reduces power delivery as it stops pulling power from the HV battery and engine is providing most of the power, roughly 55% mechanical torque straight into the PSD and about 45% through MG1 as electrical energy into MG2.Basically, I don't believe you have to warm up the engine to prevent low battery SOC in regular driving. Drive it just like a normal car and you'll be fine.
Does anyone have an opinion if I should go Toyota fitted roof racks ($465) or after-market?I'm thinking after-market as they'll be a bit cheaper and probably a wider range of accessories?
Looks like a Thule.
2nd hand Thule that have the bolt on feet, buy the RAV4 feet new and you'll save a bucket load. My 2nd hand Thule wing bar racks (overhang type) were $150 (Had fitment for a Mere A class) and were really good nick. Feet pack were $70 brand new. Eye out FB marketplace etc. The beauty of the overhang ones is that they are modular and with little cost fit from car to car.
SmellyTofu writes...fit from car to car.I reused Thule roof bars from our previous RAV4 with the new mounting kit.
We were fortunate to find a local dealer who had a couple of 2WD Hybrid Cruisers arriving in Mid-March. Took it for a quick test drive ��� felt very comfortable to drive and was surprised how much of the car bonnet I could see through the windscreen ��� felt like I was driving a big tank (not complaining). Put our deposit down for Atomic Rush ��� looking forward to picking it up in a months' time.
I have got the AWD Cruiser that has the memory seats, but for the life of me, cannot get them to work.When I program it, the buzzer comes on, but when i adjust the seat a little, and press the recall 1 or 2 button, it does not return to the programmed positionI have tried doing it in 'Ready' mode, and 'Ignition on' mode.  nothing seems to workHelp!  What am I doing wrong?
Without you sitting on it,  Put the seat in the most rear position, then all the way forward, then up then down, same with the backrest. The seats just need to be initialized and should work after that.
Smellytofu, absolute legend!  that worked!

Spoke with Toyota today in North Queensland. Best they can do for a RAV4 Cruiser AWD Hybrid with tow bar, tow ball + wiring, metallic paint, floor mats and cargo mat is $52,200. That's a lot higher then other people in this thread. The joys of living in North Queensland with limited competition in the region.
To get a new Rav4, how long should I wait in Perth? Do I pay the full amount in advance? I have the savings so can I just show the bank balance to prove that I have the means to pay when the car is ready to pick from the dealer?If it's just an advance, how much % do I pay? What would happen if I don't want to purchase the car when it's ready?Thank you.

If you decide you don't want the car anymore, you give up your deposit.
It's all in the Contract for Sale of New  Motor Vehicle that you will be required to sign. Pay a deposit (could be $500 or more, which will be forfeited if you default or breach contract). Pay balance due before taking delivery of car. If car cannot be delivered within a certain agreed time you may be able to terminate the contract. Don't know if there is a short cooling off period that may apply in WA?

D��V�� writes...Any comments on the 2.0L CVT petrol ��� a lot of the reviews say its pretty lacklustre...It's a Corolla engine put on a considerably larger and heavier car. My personal opinion is that it's not worth it to get a petrol RAV4 apart from the Edge model.
Is the cut-price servicing a scam?I have a Rav4 Hybrid which went in for a 30k service late last year.Lately a noise developed. I took it back to the dealer ��� their mechanic told me it needed a wheel alignment ��� which they didn't do at their workshop.So I took it to a local tyre dealer who did the adjustment which he said was well out. Good, I don't blame Toyota for that, it can happen with potholes, speed humps or hitting the kerb.However, I was also told that the tyre pressures ��� all round ��� were 22psi when they needed to be between 32 and 40. He pumped them up to 36.He also told me the tyres needed rotating ��� I told him that was done at the last service ��� no, he said, it wasn't.Now tyre pressure checks and wheel rotation are service items and were shown as done on my service invoice.The thought occurs ��� what else was shown as done but wasn't?Are the fixed price services leading some dealers to cut corners? To say they've done work which they haven't.Any thoughts or experiences here?

I was told last month by the sales manager it would be a four months wait for a Cruiser and Contracts to purchase motor vehicles in WA were only valid for three months The deposit was $1,000 so if you change your mind after three months your deposit is refundable

I have always found dealership service departments are hopeless with tyres.Tyre pressure should be checked by yourself at least bi monthly and rotation is often free or discounted if you go back to the same place you buy the tyres from.

I spoke to a dealer today who said Toyota has advised them the wait time for the Hybrids is coming down to 3-4 months. He mentioned that because they had not seen that yet, they keep telling customers its 6 months. Anyone heard similar things? I've been wanting one but 6 months is a little hard to swallow.
So...the dealer who sold us the Rav4 last week just told us they sold that Rav4 earlier in the day.But they have another 2 Cruiser Hybrids arriving end of April, but in the colour we didn't want.Apparently he can put in a colour change request in Mid-March, but it's only a 70% chance of being approved.Has anyone come across this scenario before?

I said great I'll come down after 4pm once I click out of work to test drive and put down a deposit. So...we did that and was all good.

skdsh writes...Dealer sales team messed up apparently...They do it intentionally. If they can make a sale they do it. Unless you paid a deposit on that car.But they should have called to tell you the car is not there. Just make a compliant on social media website of the dealer and don���t go back.
Did you get allocated a VIN ? If so I would be pissed off at them. Especially now they���re saying the replacement is not in the colour you���re after.

ok so had a weird thing happened twice in the past week.basically each time when i reversed from the garage when i turn the car on it would start in EV mode..then when i start reversing it would turn the engine on...now the engine would keep running for the duration of the drive (i even deliberately drove around extra to see if the engine would turn off).however at no point did the engine turn off at all. the battery is almost fully charged, i can see the car charging the battery and using it together with the engine, but at no point did the engine switch off at all...not even when waiting at the lights.funny thing..as soon as i turned the car off and back on..everything worked okhas this happened to anyone else?
InternalBleeding writes...funny thing..as soon as i turned the car off and back on..everything worked okhas this happened to anyone else?I'm pretty sure it's happened to me once, but I thought that is was the engine runnings itself  something like maintenance activity and the battery was full, never really noticed it happening again
skdsh writes...Apparently he can put in a colour change request in Mid-March, but it's only a 70% chance of being approved.Has anyone come across this scenario before?This falls under the banner of a spec change request. There are lots of rules but  yes it does happen and a paint change has the greatest success.  It really depends on when the request is sent and when the vehicle is scheduled to line off production. Change request  were sent to the factory on a Monday and confirmation was received back on a Tuesday. Provided the vehicle lines off at least 3 days after the Monday and "other" conditions are met the change should occur. Fairly rare for a spec change request to be successful if the vehicle lines off in the first 16 days of the production month. If the vehicle is for WA then it's unlikely to have any success.
skdsh writes...How early would the dealer know the VIN of their cars arriving?The VIN and engine no are transmitted to the vehicle file just prior to the vehicle coming off the production line. IF the vehicle is allocated to the dealer they will see it the next day. If you use "Track My Vehicle" VIN and engine no will appear while in the status "scheduled for production or in production" When they are populated you know the vehicle has been built and is on its way to the wharf or is at the wharf.Dealers generally can only see their own allocated vehicles or ones that are free and available. It gets more complicated if the vehicle is being swapped in.
I ordered Cruiser Hybrid through a broker a month ago. The dealer sent me confirmation along with tracking details for the Toyota portal which still shows Status = On order, Production = To be confirmed. Broker reassures me everything is on track, but what's strange is that I still haven't received a contract or paid a deposit with the dealership. Not sure if this is different due to going through the fleet system.Feel like I should have something more concrete than just my name in a portal, which I assume a dealer could easily manipulate just to request new orders and secure extra stock.Anyone had a similar experience?
Pradopete writes...This falls under the banner of a spec change request. There are lots of rules but  yes it does happen and a paint change has the greatest success.  It really depends on when the request is sent and when the vehicle is scheduled to line off production. Change request  were sent to the factory on a Monday and confirmation was received back on a Tuesday. Provided the vehicle lines off at least 3 days after the Monday and "other" conditions are met the change should occur. Fairly rare for a spec change request to be successful if the vehicle lines off in the first 16 days of the production month. If the vehicle is for WA then it's unlikely to have any success.We're in VIC, with the expected delivery delivery date 23 April. Our dealer said he will know by next Thursday whether we can get the spec change for the colour we want. Based on the delivery date can you estimate the date it lines off production?
Does anyone know if while using CarPlay or android auto you can use the voice command button on the steering wheel to trigger ���hey siri / hey google���? Will it use the mic system in the car or on the phone?
skdsh writes...Based on the delivery date can you estimate the date it lines off production?My educated guess is between the 16 and 23 March. Shipped on 26 march. 17 days steaming to Melbourne, 2 days to clear wharf, 4 days on wharf processing 3 days transit metro dealer. Having said that there are lots of variables to that, Quarintine, backlog of  on wharf processing (prior ships), truck availabilty, OEM shortages, strikes, Covid etc, etc, ETA calculation is far from an exact science. Years ago I' ve seen shipments held in Quarintine for upto 4 weeks when beatles, nuts, leaves, bat droppings etc, have been found on just one vehicle. Whole shipment in each port have had to go through decontamination.

skdsh writes...I'm interested in the reasoning behind if possible?I'm going back a few years so I might not be 100%. It's was a timing issue. WA /NT only got 1 ship per month from Japan. East Coast 1 per week. Also WA is an independent distributor and some of the system were not real time with TMCA. For east coast it is purely a timing issue. You can't do s spec change until production is confirmed then it's a timing issue around Mondays and when the the vehicle is scheduled to line off. Also the factory can be running ahead or behind in any one month usually 1-3 days. About 8- 10 % of planned production lines off not in the scheduled month.

They told us what colour the car would be upfront as they had already put this order in (silver) if the colour change request (blue) didn't go through. Disappointing...but it's just a colour in the end ��� and we're ok with it. We just really wanted a Rav4 and were already thinking of putting in an order before our car was written off. Just bad timing overall for us.
skdsh writes...They told us what colour the car would be upfront as they had already put this order in (silver)Ah ha.  Ok, well, they would've known full well that there were two chances of changing the colour.    Car paint is one of the first thing done when making a new car.   Once the panels are pressed and secured, then it's off to paint.   If  your car is now due in mid to late April, then it's basically already a finished product waiting at the docks to be loaded.The absolute best that the dealer might have been able to achieve was a 'swap' or 'trade' with another dealer that had your colour on order.My point is, car dealers say basically nothing that is true or factually correct.  They'll say whatever they can to secure your money, something like 'We'll more than likely be able to change the colour, but can't do anything without a commitment" from you.  Just sign here.In other news, I really hope you enjoy your Rav.   I've had mine for two years in July and still love it as much today as the day I picked it up.
Feathers writes...In other news, I really hope you enjoy your Rav.   I've had mine for two years in July and still love it as much today as the day I picked it up.Very excited, as this will be the first new car I've bought. I started looking at SUV reviews a few months ago, as my wife and I were looking to upgrade from our Corolla hatch (moving from 1 kid to 2 later this year). I'm not a car person, so knew essentially nothing about the demand for Rav4s in Australia and somehow never really noticed them on the road. Took one look at a video review and fell in love with the shape and look of it.
Just ordered a 2WD Cruiser hybrid in crystal pearl, also my first new car. Got it for $47.5k DA in Melbourne, no trade in. Was told 5-6 months, might come earlier but no promises.I had to call a second dealer to eek out that price but sounds like some people got AWD for a similar price.. are some people reporting prices without mentioning if they are tradinf in? Because good prices aren't good deals if you are sacrificing trade value..
Been quoted $49,800 for AWD Cruiser Graphite with floormats, bootmat and sidesteps in Adelaide. 4-6 months wait time apparently.Prices have seemed to be a bit higher here than in eastern states so not sure how much better I can get. Any thoughts?
phot0n writes...I had to call a second dealer to eek out that price but sounds like some people got AWD for a similar price.. are some people reporting prices without mentioning if they are tradinf in?Nah I got an AWD Hybrid Cruiser with premium paint and a towkit for $48650, no trade in, and some people have gotten a bit lower than that. NSW though, not sure about the difference between NSW and VIC pricing.

Just found that Rav4 Prime may come to Australia or not but I like the 2 colour options. Hope they bring it to us.
Not sure why Toyota executives decideded to produce so many different RAV4 variants like Harrier and Suzuki Across while they can���t keep up with the demands for the standard RAV4 hybrid for so long. They should concentrate the production like Soviet Union did with the T-34.That way they will probably suffocate the smaller players and eat up even more market share.

Prime is a Plug-in Hybrid

uggugg writes...Prime is a Plug-in HybridI think it would by a 60k car IMHO.. maybe more.
hippyhippy writes...I think it would by a 60k car IMHO.. maybe more.The Prime comes in 2 trim levels, but the base model is $USD38k, one would hope this translates to $AUD48k, but I wouldn't hold my breath. The top trim level Prime is $USD47k = $AUD59k, so you may be right..The US trim levels don't really line up with ours, but the base models do seem to line up with features. The US model RAV4 LE starts at $USD25k = $AUD32k, this is pretty close to the our base model RAV4 GX at $AUD31.7, so it doesn't appear there is an "Australia tax" (at least on the base model).
does anyone feel, RAV4 alloy wheels looks ugly and outdated. Not sure how they chose this styling.

Took delivery today for my 2WD Cruiser. I love it so far! I didn't realise I've had it in eco mode... Has performed perfectly well so will likely leave it.Everything else about it is overwhelming...

Not much difference between Eco and Normal but Sport is noticeably quicker off the mark
phot0n writes...The top trim level Prime is $USD47k = $AUD59k, so you may be right..That's closer to $AUD61k and excluding on road costs though. Probably $AUD66-67k driveaway. If the higher trim levels of the hybrid RAV4 is any indication, there will be a lot of features missing on the Australian model for a similar price to the US model.
Rendog writes...One of the reasons I was attracted to the cruiser was the back wheelsyep. Black is good. My question is through out trim levels, they should have provided 'Chrome alloy'. Just saying, nothing against vehicle.
Any recommendations on seat covers? Black duck seem pretty good.

Hi all,Does anyone know what a good price on a new manual GX is?
Does anyone know what a good price on a new manual GX is?About 3 Grand less than the price of the GX Hybrid you should get instead.GX Hybrid has automatic dual zone climate control air and projector headlights, which are not available on the GX Petrol. With the model upgrades in July last year, the GX Hybrid is virtually equivalent to a 2019 GXL and its features.The hybrid drive train has more grunt than the petrol engine and uses 4.7 litres per 100k.  The hybrid is why this RAV4 is special, not the form factor, which you can get cheaper in other makes (Bitsoshitti / Nissan etc)
Ozebloke1 writes...About 3 Grand less than the price of the GX Hybrid you should get instead.Closer to $4.5k difference drive away, but yeah if I were to recommend a petrol RAV4 I'd only recommend the Edge.

Fair.  Accurate.  I didn���t check the cost was rather making the point... Thanks for the correction- $4.5k is a step up.  But if cost is your main concern there are cheaper SUVs of a similar size
Is Graphite a good colour option for Rav4 ?I am thinking of buying a Rav4 in Graphite color. Is this color easy to maintain : Does it show a lot of dust ? Are the scratches quite visible on this metallic color ? I already have a Silver Camry, so do not want another silver. Please let me know your thoughts on graphite color or any other popular colors in this car.
Endeave writes...Is Graphite a good colour option for Rav4 ?I have a Graphite RAV4 and in my opinion it looks good. It's probably one of the more popular colour choice along with the 2 whites (Glacier White and Crystal Pearl). Dust / dirt will be visible after a while, but not as bad as some other colour options. Haven't really noticed any scratches on mine, but I've only had it for 4 months or so.

Ah you're talking about the badge being matte black, sorry I thought you were referring to the whole car. Look on AliExpress there's tons of stuff like that for exterior and interior of the car (but beware of the quality of some of them).
@Maulzy ��� i think around $36k or less might be decent.Then minus $1k if you exclude navigation.
FennAU writes...being asked to get paint protection?Dealer products/up-sell is usually avoided.  You can do it yourself with a sealant.  I'm happy with what I can achieve myself with quality off-the-shelf auto products. Alternatively, a more expensive solution is a professionally applied ceramic coating. And that will require less ongoing maintenance.

Noob q because I can't be bothered to RTFM.Is the proximity key supposed to lock the car if I walk away?If so, what are some reasons it didn't work when I went to the shops before?

niko123456000 writes...Is the proximity key supposed to lock the car if I walk away?I don't believe this is a feature with the RAV4 ?(Cruiser spec) With key in proximity, you can touch the ridged area on the driver or front passenger handle, and it will lock. There is also a small button above the license plate on the tailgate that will proximity lockSimilarly, touching anywhere on driver or front passenger handle with key in proximity will unlock, and the main powered tailgate button above the license plate will also unlock
It���s not a feature, I wish it wereAlso be careful if the car is running, and you walk away with the key the car will still keep going and you can drive away without it.
niko123456000 writes...Is the proximity key supposed to lock the car if I walk away?No if you leave the car going and take the key it does not turn off so engine is running and if you turn off the RAV4 it won't auto lock when you go away.Learnt the hard way, my partner took the key as I went to park the RAV4, it was still going as the key went into the shopping center, I realized too late when I finally saw the ''no key found light was on'', so I went and parked the RAV4 and called her so I could lock it..
What is key fob like on the other models, the GX remote is very cheap looking plastic ��� doesnt look like it will last very long. I'm surprised they cut back on something so obvious where you can notice the quality.
The ridges on the door handle to lock, and a button on the tailgate to lock are not just Cruiser spec.  GXL works the same way, except we don't have the powered tailgate.

Interesting video on how to maintain battery filter in order to prolong battery lifehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1l-JNGMTEs
Americans have pretty whacky views when it comes to servicing stuff. Generally they overpay for everything (oil change every 3000 miles) so this DIY stuff is probably an antidote to that. Surely the way to go is just to stick to the service routine? I wouldn't mess around with stuff to do with the battery to give anyone an excuse.The battery is under warranty for 10 years and the thing that will extend the life is the fact it sits for a middle charge and never dips to zero or charges to full. Don't think you need to worry much more.
Has anyone had experience with Comma2?

Rendog writes...Battery warranty only applies if you service it with the dealershipIs that true?

It's not the greatest but you also need to adjust the front/rear balance to be slightly to the rear. Once I did that it sounded much better (from the driver's seat anyway, I'm not sure how it sounds in the rear seats).

Wait time varies depending on your dealer and some luck on whether the Toyota ordering system decides to grant your order based on some unknown criteria. 2-3 months would be a good result, it's been over 6 months for the worst cases.The FB group https://www.facebook.com/groups/AustraliansWaitingforToyota2020RAV4s have started a Google spreadsheet tracking members' ordershttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qBFC1Ah55f2zgl4TyzT28h40p4CHxPgkeyDkTlL3OQ/edit?usp=sharing

After a month of driving our new Cruiser Hybrid, I'm very happy with it except for the following:After being forced to travel on a long unsealed road (to attend a wedding), it took several attempts to wash away all dust from between external plastic trims on the tailgate.The tailgate motors are now a bit noisier after that particular drive (having gotten dust all over that area).The dealer did not perform the following in pre-delivery:Set the correct tyre pressures (were still at transit level of 53 psi)Adjust the headlight beam (set way too low).
PomOz writes...didn't seem to have a sub-woofer?I think you just need to crank up the Bass in the audio settings.I found it fine as soon as I did this.I also kept mid as is and turned down treble a little.The sub is in the luggage area on the left.It also depends on the music you listen to :)
Yes defs about the music .. and as I said yes I should've taken longer to try out adjustments.  I'm sure it'll be fine.However now my other 'alf doesn't like the gloss black wheels on the cruiser. So could be changing them now.
So are the main 'negatives' of the Hybrid Cruiser spec when compared to similar competition this:?- No ventilated seats- No panoramic sunroof- Poor quality reversing camera- Poor quality 360 cameras- Poor quality infotainment screen- No automated park assist (VW/Skoda/Ford,Kia, Hyundai, etc offer this)- No digital dash- No HUD???Or are there some other gaps?
WIth the 2021 Camry SL Hybrid getting a panoramic roof and HUD. Do we think the MY22 RAV4 Hybrid may get these too?
Currently trying to order an Crystal Pearl AWD Hybrid Cruiser with mats and tow bar. Sci Fleet Taringa's current best price is $51,500.00 driveaway with 6 months rego and free tint. Anybody have luck getting more of a discount in QLD? Happy to buy wherever in QLD as I don't mind a roadtrip.
PomOz writes...However now my other 'alf doesn't like the gloss black wheels on the cruiserThey suit certain colours very well. We have the glacier white, which looks awesome. I think the crystal pearl and the graphite also look good with the gloss black. The other colours not so much.Having said that, they only look good when they're sparkling clean. At least it doesn't take long to keep them that way. Other mag wheels are awful to clean up and take well over half hour to do it properly.
Not often a deal breaker:- No ventilated seatsIt is unfortunate, but still not a deal breaker:- No panoramic sunroofThey're only needed to be able to see if there are obstructions:- Poor quality reversing camera- Poor quality 360 camerasI hadn't noticed any issues:- Poor quality infotainment screenI have no trouble parking without this feature:- No automated park assist (VW/Skoda/Ford,Kia, Hyundai, etc offer this)You mean digital speedo? You can switch between the 2:- No digital dashThis would be useful, I do admit:- No HUD

Back to 5.3 for the current tank ��� I���ve been finding it���s noticeably worse during rainy days, and we���ve had quite a few lately.

niko123456000 writes...I thought I've been doing a decent enough job moderating my driving but who knowsAs I said it depends on where you live and are driving to. I have 2 ways of getting to work, the most efficient way I get 4.0-4.3 consistently, but if I take the hillier route I have never achieved better than 5.6. That's quite a big difference percentage wise. So don't feel too bad if your numbers don't look great.If you want to try to get better efficiency, the best advice I can offer is to try and follow the blue bar as closely as possible when accelerating and cruising, and also break much earlier than you would with other cars. Using Eco mode also helps as it also uses the air con more efficiently.
niko123456000 writes...but now I've gone and put E10 in and it's more like 6.2I only use E10 (as it's specified in the fill area) and constantly get 5.7l/100km.

Got a bit of an annoyance with my RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid ��� the air conditioner seems to make a bit of a coil whining noise. Can't hear it with the radio on, but can definitely hear a faint high pitched squeaking/squealing when stopped at lights + radio off. Anyone experienced anything similar?
Mine is not an electrical noise but a whistling noise like a wind whistle. Happens if I���ve got the AC on and not on recirc mode, fan speed 4-5. Is to do with the AC and no fix (Rav4world people mentioned this). Sucks to be young with ok hearing particularly at high frequency.

Hi, please need advice on picking up the new car. What should we do before and what should be checked when picking up. We are asked to do bank transfer for the balance before picking up. Then what if we find anything wrong with the car. Thanks!
Dealer predelivery checkover should detect any "problems". However the predelivery washing could leave micro swirl marks in paint on dark paint. You could check the odometer to ensure only delivery miles travelled. Operational problems would be detected later and are a warranty fix.
Weighing up options: Cruiser AWD Hybrid with metallic paint, tow bar, rubber mats, full fuel tank, 12 month rego.Melbourne dealer 1: $50,600; 'committing' to a 4-5 month delivery timeMelbourne dealer 2: $50,000; 'committing' to a 6-8 month delivery timeDealer 1 is one of the biggest Toyota dealers in Australia and says they are not clogging their pipeline with novated leasing deals. Also says they have a good relationship with Toyota given their size and so can commit to better time line.Dealer 2 is a big dealership for Melbourne but not as big as dealer one. Says dealer 1 is dreaming and reckons he will bait and switch on the time line. Thinks his 6-8 month time line is more realistic.Impossible to know who to believe.

Back right was 38.5, front right was 37, front left was 37.5 and back left was 36.5.I just checked mine, as I got a bit of a lecture on my other car when I got the tyres replaced.. apparently the fact I never did anything with the pressure contributed to the tyres wearing quite thin.So I bought this gadget: https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B081YVKGLP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1And like you, I got an average of about 37 on all the tyres. Car was at dealership a week or so ago for a 1000km check, so they've obviously pumped them up to this amount on purpose.It seems high to me, compared to 33 (lots of people say, rule of thumb is add +2) but I guess I'll leave it rather than fiddle.

Thoughts?I wouldn't be surprised if your estimated delivery time blows out. I just got an email today saying delays in delivery are expected due to demand and production issues.Also, see if you can push for a slightly better price. I ordered a more or less identical car, metallic, tow, mats and boot mat and got it for $48,800 driveaway with 12 months rego and full tank. Signed contract and placed order two weeks ago.
smarki writes...Impossible to know who to believe. I did read something about not all dealerships being the same with regards to throughput. Thoughts?Can you put the delivery date as a condition of the contract? But you loose either way. If no car after 5 months, you cancel the contract (if they let you), you still have no car and will be back to the end of line if buy somewhere else.From what I understand dealerships pre-order cars based on forecast, they may not get what they ask for, or sometimes there are conditions like for X number of popular cars they also have to take Y number of unpopular cars. Bottom line is larger the dealership more cars on pre-order, but they also have more customers in queue. So you would never know where you are in the line.

@Foamer. Which dealer did you get the $48,800 price from?Which state?
I ordered a GX manual on 25 Feb, delivered on 30 March. Paid $35 250. I guess there are advantages to buying a manual in terms of wait times. Very happy with the vehicle so far.
smarki writes...@Foamer. Which dealer did you get the $48,800 price from?Which state?I got it through Llewellyn in QLD, $48,770 to be precise. That price was through a referral to the sales manager through a contact, but it is proof that there is wiggle room when bargaining.By comparison, Sci Fleet Toyota's first offer for the exact same car, plus tint was $51,500. Gave me the usual, high demand, not allowed to negotiate spiel. Estimated delivery end of July, but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets pushed out...

Yeah I know. No doubt trying to take advantage of the long wait times. I wonder how much it could be brought down.Worth asking do you reckon?
Rusty1989 writes...Yeah I know. No doubt trying to take advantage of the long wait times. I wonder how much it could be brought down.Worth asking do you reckon?For that amount of money I would just buy new/demo direct from the dealer. I know the wait times can be a bit of a put off, but depending on the dealer, there is still floor stock around. The FWD hybrid cruiser I test drove was available for immediate purchase. We don't need a car immediately so didn't mind waiting the extra months to get the exact spec/colour/options on the car we wanted
So, finally went to the dealership to check out the RAV4 Cruiser today. And it was all good until I looked over at the missus in the passengers seat and noticed bugger all clearance. Thought ok, just adjust the seat, should be fine. Nup, it won't go down. And sure, you can lean it back, but then you lose space behind, and it's really not that much better. Went around to sit in there myself, got in, got out, and came home. And I'm not that tall ��� 6 foot. Am I missing something? Are just short people buying this car? Or they just don't care about the passenger?
Just signed off on a Cruiser, AWD in Sydney. All prepared to wait 6-8 months, but apparently they had one unsold in their next stock allotment. Delivered in 6 weeks, it���s close to being shipped. Pearl white. No real haggling room, and it didn���t bother us. $51k

Moonroof cuts a few cms of space off the top. If you don���t mind getting the GXL/GX you can get a bit more clearanceBut yes it���s annoying the passenger seat doesn���t have the electric adjustments including up/down

For those with hybrids how often and where to you charge your car? We're looking into the rav4 but not sure about charging options due to renting.
xOverRated writes...For those with hybrids how often and where to you charge your car? We're looking into the rav4 but not sure about charging options due to renting.They're hybrids, not plug-ins. They don't plug in, the battery is charged from the motor and braking/slowing down. There is a plug-in version, but it's not available in Australia.

I don't think we will see it in Australia.
Thanks greebs and rendog, will try book a test drive.
Anyone did a leg fog light upgrade (talking while unit, not a led bulb)I have just brought a USA toyota OEM set to put in mine when it arrives
greebs writes...it was all good until I looked over at the missus in the passengers seat and noticed bugger all clearance.Anyone else finding clearance a problem in the front passenger seat?
Any one swapped out the standard grill with the edge grill/front?
I'm 6ft and I sat it the passenger seat of a Cruiser yesterday.There isn't a huge amount of clearance but I wasn't bumping my head or anything, so it was fine.My feeling is that you just lean the seat back one notch if you are taller. Or you get the GXL, which doesn't have the moonroof.The only space thing that bothers me is how the centre console blocks my left leg from leaning over. Feels a little more constrictive on the left leg that what I currently drive. I'm sure I will get used to it or find a leg position that suits though.

Ozebloke1 writes...I checked the manual and inside the drivers door which recommended 33psi ��� as you say.Had my car serviced today and they said have the tyres pumped at 40psi.I guess the 33psi on the manual is just the minimum??
Dunno the "true" answer.  I have asked 'experts' at Toyota Service Dept, Tyre Power, Bob Jane and Good Year.Answers varied from 1. Must go with the recommendation on the door (ie. 33 psi) coz "thats what the manufacturer says"2. 36 PSI ��� "go a bit higher than the recommended to get better fuel economy and less tyre wear"3. 38 to 40 PSI ��� "the higher the longer the tyres will last"The only thing that is certain that no one has recommended tyre pressures less than 33 PSI  (unless driving on soft sand)

Sbruris writes...3. 38 to 40 PSI ��� "the higher the longer the tyres will last"Going higher will wear them out just as quick, just in the centre rather than the sides
Quicker in the centre in fact coz the contact patch is now concentrated in the centre and not across the tread.I run 33. Rotate them every 5k myself. They���re economy tyres so should last way too long for my liking plus the comfy ride puts less stress on other components of the car.
#Zenot writes...I guess the 33psi on the manual is just the minimum??No. It���s what you set it to. No more. No less. Let���s not add your own interpretation.

#Zenot writes...Guess I should leave it at 33psi.Why are we getting alot of different interpretations when the manual says one thing?Because people like adding their own opinions as expert advice. Remember that people who works at tire stores and service departments are not the same people who engineer tyres and design cars. The ladder group specifies the pressure on both the user manual and door jam.
Any thoughts on continuous variable transmission (CVT) in Rav 4s from the last few years? Keep hearing people saying negative things about it, citing Nissan xtrails that have issues due to the CVT.Is it a potential issue with recent Rav 4s as well?
Toyota have been paring Hybrids to CVTs for many years now and are different to the Jatco units used in Nissan.

Ok thanks for the replies about CVT.Another query, my 2018 Rav4 GLX has a small camera inside a rectangular box mounted on the upper part of the windscreen behind the rear vision mirror, facing straight forward towards the road. Is this camera to do with lane departure assist and the like? It is not a recording camera at all?As I would like to install a dash cam, but don't see any recording/vision option in the screen options. Another issue is this box seems to be obstructing the dashcam vision somewhat (if attached to the rear vision mirror).

Pretty easy to install, just tuck it into the trim and run under the front seat to rear cig lighter power, easy. Saved $100 on an Airtasker install.

The sound is similar Honda CRV (current gen) sound in the engine where it sounds thrashy or a whinie noise.That thrashy noise has nothing to do with eCVT, it���s just how the 4 cylinder engine sounds at constant RPM.I have the RX450h and GS450h and they never sound trashy, but a nice growl (especially the GS) because of the 3.5L v6 that is nicely insulated by vibration and sound proofing on the chassis.I have also driven the LS600h at length. Again the 5.0L engine doesn���t sound trashy, it���s silent at throttle.All 3 are eCVT driven.
Name one 4 banger from any manufacturer that is remotely as smooth as a 2GR? Of course the inherent nature of a 4 Cyl is going to be a bit rough around the edges. I���m getting used to the throttle note of the A25A motor and whilst it���s not exciting, it���s not offensive either like say the 5SFE

My parents are currently looking at the GXL petrol, should I convince them to go the hybrid despite the new tax in Victoria? What price should we be roughly aiming for with the GXL 2WD in Melbourne?
New tax? If you mean the tax on electric vehicles, it won't apply to hybrids. Otherwise what sort of driving will your parents be doing? In urban traffic the advantages of the hybrid (economy, driveability etc) really shine, out in the country much less so.

They live in suburban Melbourne so they're doing that sort of driving. I'll see what sort of price I can get the GXL 2WD hybrid for.
The Rav4 in conventional format is excellent, but little to differentiate it from a range of others in similar class. The hybrid, in any trim level is the absolute standout, although the pick is probably the AWD Cruiser. The engine and transmission on the hybrid is remarkably good and, has stunning performance, aside from the economy aspects.
Quick question to all Rav4 (Hyb) owners, do you get charge for additional labor fee for wear and tear parts replacement?

Hi ��� looking at updating the 10 year old ix35 diesel for a Rav 4 hybrid ��� looks like a long wait for them. i was going to look for an alternative but nothing seems to stand out for fuel economy and reliability.   i do a fair bit of country driving but want to move away from diesel as its not really the future. hired a Corolla hybrid the other day and in town was getting 3.3-3.5 L PER 100K including some highway travel. question ��� do you think when the tucson and Kluger hybrids come out it will help ease up supply.
Bathurst to Sydney was 4L/100km albeit mostly downhill.Supply wise, you���re going to struggle. Kruger will be another hot item with dealers not doing deals expecting another repeat of RAV4.Unfortunately there���s no other way about it if you want a hybrid whatever. You���re going to have to wait or buy an overpriced used car.

After a 2.5 months wait, we finally took delivery of our Cruiser Hybrid this afternoon. Very happy with it so far. I've turned off the annoying school zone warnings, lowered the volume of the boot beeping. Still have lots settings to play around with.Talking to one salesman who assisted with delivery today, he told us he sold a Rav4 today and had to tell this customers (as directed by his DP) the expected delivery was in May 2022....just crazy.
13 month wait ! That is crazy ��� you would think that other manufacturers would build what people desire not what their marketing people think will be a good idea. There would be a midlife upgrade in that time frame. Maybe the chip manufacturers will increase production. I find this amazing that capacity can���t increase in 24 months. I am waiting for refinancing to be approved before putting an order in. I hope the old car goes ok in the next few months.

Can anyone confirm on their hybrid Toyota service list what grade of oil is used? I do my own oil change at 6 months rather than wait for 12 months before I take it to Toyota for its 12 month service and went to buy oil and filter from them but was told the closest grade to preferred in the manual they could sell me is 5w-30.I bought Penrite 0w-16 and the difference was noticeable. It���s been 6 months and 5000k. The oil that came out definitely looked and smelled used, not bad but fussy me wouldn���t have wanted to keep it there for another 6 months.Feels smoother in general especially under load and the switch to petrol when moving seems to be less noticeable...not that it wasn���t good before, just all round a little nicer to drive. I was surprised that Toyota spare parts couldn���t give me what the manual asks for as preferred option and was wondering if the service dept has been using a thicker grade?
Will these sequential indicators fit in the 2021 RAV4? It's listed as 2020 compatible, so I'm quite sure it will, but just wanted to double check.https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B08C7LT7P9/ref=cbw_us_au_dp_ags?smid=A4XRJ8S0WXSO0
went to buy oil and filter from them but was told the closest grade to preferred in the manual they could sell me is 5w-30.This does not bode well if the Toyota dealer doesn't stock 0w-16 when it is required.
It's possible they only have the 0w16 in drums, not in packs suitable for retail
The only 0W16 I���ve seen in retail packaging was from Nulon. Didn���t seem well and the supercheapauto were discounting them heavily. There are 5W20 which is closer I use in my Prius. I don���t know if I can say it makes any difference given the variables at play.Btw, what filter did you get? I usually but then in packs of 10 for the Prius (family all run 2ZR motors) from the Sydney dealers that sell on eBay but not seen any for the RAV4.
Driving on radar cruise...Random beeping with nothing (no message, icon flash etc) on the dash... What is it?It's not the lane keep, that has a flashing icon.Is it the car being over the speed limit by accident?
It���s when the car is over your limit set for CC, for some reason it doesn���t brake to bring you under the limit, it only brakes when it detects a car in front of you
you can also bond the settings to a key so if you open with key 1 it will go to position 1 setting and using second key will go to position 2 etc

The spare parts counter had it in 5 litre (?)  packs when last in there 6 months back. They said it was for Prius (0���16 from memory).RAV was serviced last week where they confirmed using 0���20.

Damn Dirty Apes writes...I do my own oil change at 6 months rather than wait for 12 months before I take it to Toyota for its 12 month serviceYes a good idea to do 6 month oil changes but should probably be a "qualified mechanic" to do them on account of if anything goes wrong at least it should be covered under warranty.At least that way Toyota couldn't just dismiss a claim for some engine related fault due to unlicensed workI wouldn't get Toyota to do it as they are too expensive but if you have a trusted workshop that you have used previously then go there instead

blutek writes...RAV was serviced last week where they confirmed using 0���20im curious if it lists on the receipt what brand the oil was.if it was castrol it seems they only offer 0W-20 for trade.
The  service invoice shows Castrol Magnatec Professional A3  10W30.  However we were advised "0 20 used".
I worked at an oil manufacturer in the lab. They make many brands of oil using a base oil with some additives requested. A good chance it���s made in a similar place. I did hear that the specific oil was difficult to find by a mechanic. I trust if it���s done though Toyota they will take the heat if there are any issues. I wouldn���t do my own with a similar oil as by doing an spectrum analysis it���s easy to detect the incorrect oil. I would follow the guide. I have an ix35 diesel and it���s done nearly 200,000 no issue with oil usage or motor issues. I just followed the service guide. Much cheaper than a new motor or warranty / accc issues.

Dove in and got the hybrid cruiser AWD with tinting and cargo mat for $49,888 da in NSW. Was meant to include fleet discount but seems might have overpaid after reading this thread.

Try waiting 9mth a year ago. The wait is worth it and gives you time to sell your old car privately for more coin.

How does automatic rear view mirror work at night?Have tried setting it at auto (light is on) but oncoming lights from rear view are still very bright
Does anyone know why the dash and screen brightness sometimes goes from bright during daytime, to dim at about dusk, before getting brighter again at night?Tried going through all settings to no avail but this is really bugging me now. I've put up with it since I've got the car for over a year but hoping someone knows how to fix this.
Auto headlights. There is a sensitivity setting you can adjust (RTBM for details).

I'm wondering if it has anything to do with me manually opening the mirror when the car was off to install the turning light. When I went to unlock the car to turn the hazard lights on for some testing it initiated it usual 'auto-open mirrors' sequence. There was a loud click/clunk at the end of the mirror motor noise sequence like it was trying to get the mirror back on the right gear/track. Could that cause an issue? Right now after testing multiple times, the auto open/close seems to work ok in terms of being smooth/doing its job, as the opening and closing sequences start at the same time and there's no worrying noises...only that there's a difference in when the sequences finish.3rd EDIT:I took a look at the car manual this morning and it talks about manually adjusting the mirrors if you require...don't know if manually adjusting the mirrors has anything to do with it...or why there was a loud clunk noise when going back to the auto function.

Thanks. It���s too much trouble as it is buying more wiring to fix the issue.Meantime I���ve focused on adding additional brake lights on the bumper replacing the standard reflectors given how small and unnoticeable the standard ones are.

FlashShynobi writes...Anyone can help in regards to the auto-dimming rear mirror in the middle of the car?Works by taking a light reading in front and comparing the difference to the back. If back is brighter than the front, then dim.During the day,  run your hands on the mirror facing the front of the car to find the sensor. Cover the sensor with your finger and the mirror should dim slowly.

Have a rented base model RAV Hybrid from Hertz at the moment, pretty impressed. If buying I think I'd be happy with the base model but with AWD. Any idea what the current delivery time is at the moment (Melbourne) and can any of the car brokers get a better deal that do it yourself?

So 703 which model did you get? For me the 17��� wheels are ok, quite like 65 sidewall for the nice ride. Yes agreed a leather steering wheel would be nicer. With colours the range doesn���t really grab me. I like white cars so would probably go with plain white.

My parents are looking at replacing my mothers CX-3 with a Rav 4 Hybrid (probably just a GX or GXL).

Looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about to be honest over differing roads/conditions.As for the wait time, it seems majority of people are getting Cruisers, does this make the GX Hybrid any easier to get in dealers (we are in Qld) or is it same ol same ol 6+ month for even the base models?

So our upgrade would be a lightly used 2017+ Rx450h.  But used prices are off the charts for Lexus hybrids so will wait.
For those who sign up and delivery is many months time, I presume that your contact would say that you pay for any new price increases including for the new 2022 model which you would likely get. Is that correct?

@ringo .. almost identical to my situation. But they seemed to say despite the June build, delays are expected and October / November more likely. I'm hoping they're just setting my expectations then it'll arrive earlier with surprise call to let me know!
Those with the dashcam option.. is it true they record activity while you're away from the car? So some dickhead decides to give you some extra paint at the supermarket, then leaves, and you're not there, the dashcam system records continuously and you have evidence. No active ignition required, runs off the battery.
This will depend on the system you buy and if they have that feature. I have the Blackvue 900 and the camera is constantly on and if it feels a bump it will record from 5seconds prior for a minute.The camera runs off the battery and will be on for a few hours before turning off. So plenty of time in a parking lot or when you head to down to the cafe.
@QrsL .. yep no worries. I was asking about the standard Toyota dashcam option for the RAV4 I was offered but turned down and might have FOMO now ;o)
just wait for a Repco 30% off sale on their blackvue cams and get them installed by a 3rd party professional and it will be way more cheaper than if you went with Toyota.Toyota offered be $1600 for their chinese branded dash cam plus labour. Definitely would recommend not getting it from toyota
Anyone know the wait time for Cruiser Hybrid?
Question: if there is a 10 to 12 month wait as I am seeing on facebook groups, why are people not just waiting for the 2022 model?
If you're waiting in 2022, you'll be waiting long enough to get the 2023 model

I bought a set of LEDs from Amazon. Absolutely no issues so far. They're nice and bright now. It came with 2 for the licence plate but they're already LED, so I swapped the puddles lights to LED too.I've also installed the 2x cargo lights. A bit more fiddly than installing the other interior lights as you need to take a few interior trims off and thread the cables though the car and rubber pipes. But they're definitely worth it.

Also no lights in the glove box or power windows switches (drivers excluded) is not cool
Toyota have been cheaping out for years.I bought a new Camry hybrid, and had a VF Commodore company car at the same time and the Commodore felt like twice the car.Camry had no glove box light, rear parcel shelf was cheap plastic, centre console moved at the slightest touch. On a hoist you can see the cheap pressed steel components, whereas the Commodore had the mult-link with cast or forged aluminium components. Also had expensive aluminium bonnet and bootlid to keep weight down.  Commodore was built as solid as a rock and you can see the strength and tech engineered in.If it weren���t the simply staggeringly good hybrid drivetrain you wouldn���t even bother. I���d still happily buy a RAV4 and I love the looks. But I would go into a future Toyota purchase with my eyes wide open.
yeah i agree Auto,Toyota cars do feel cheapish and you can see it some of the parts, but they are very reliable and cheap to fix. And at first I was not a Hybrid believer at all, i used to hate it etc, until I actually started driving one, and yes have to agree the drive train is pretty good.If only Holden made more Australian built/designed/reliable economical cars :-) but unfortunately in the end its the bottom dollar that counts etc.
Agree with Auto, if you open the front door and look towards the front you can see the metal panel from the front of the car doesnt even wrap around to the main car frame and you see the foam, etc. Very disappointed with these kind of short cuts.
InternalBleeding writes...did you end up breaking any clips when taking off the roof lights etc?The centre console lights were the toughest. The Youtube tutorials make it look a tad easier. Maybe because it's the 1st time we were trying to pop it out...but it's very, very stubborn and doesn't want to come out. I did break half of one of the clips, but luckily I could turn it it a bit and it still popped back in properly.Same story for every other time I had to remove a trim which was connected by a plastic clip/pin. They're weren't easy to pop out at all.
Did the dome light and reversing lights, followed YouTube, no problems.
InternalBleeding writes...anyone whos fitted the led interior globes, did that cause any canbus issues? errors? issues?Toyota generally don't utilise any CANBUS across light circuits.
great...I've placed a order for the same led interior lights as skdsh
Auto writes...If it weren���t the simply staggeringly good hybrid drivetrain you wouldn���t even botheThat���s correct. Current Toyota models are cheaply made everything apart from the drive train. Which is top class.Toyota is doing this to fund research for their Ev using solid state and hydrogen cars.Tried to access the RAV4 hybrid 12v battery? The plastic tabs that hold the cover in was already half broken in a brand new car.Check this out on all the bits they cheaped out on the Camry. This will be more so on the RAV4.

Mich��l writes...Does the 2021 RAV4 have a Li-ion battery?Nope, still NiMH. Only the Camry was changed to Li-ion for this year's model.
the solid state battery can't be too far away.
InternalBleeding writes...what are peoples experience with the penrite oil 0w-16I just put Nulon 0W-16 into my Prius over the weekend. I'll let you know if the engine blows up.
I am glad they stick with nickel metal hydride and I have an order on a AWD Cruiser hybrid and proven reliability with current battery. Battery technology is changing so fast, we need one that doesn't catch fire and more energy density but not sacrificing safety and recyclability.
waner0 writes...I am glad they stick with nickel metal hydrideMy Prius is Li-ion and its going great. 9 years and 160,000km now.
I wish I had Li-ion. My NiMH overheats too quickly after charging to 70%. I'll pick up at least 3 degrees easily every time so if I am already at 41C which it easily will hit even on a cool autumn/winters day, it'd hit the 44C threshold without the fan really going hard made even worse if I park the car at 70% charge, it will continue to heat up whilst parked.The fan only starts spinning at 36C and is speed sensitive in increments of 0-25kmh at fan speed 2, 26-6xkmh at 2.5, 6x-80kmh at 3. If most of your drive is less than 60kmh, then the fan won't go fast enough to cool things down quickly or with any urgency. Even when it overheats, the fan program will not change speed unless you're driving over those threshold.In my Li ion Prius v, I have never hit the heat threshold and never needed to trigger the fan manually.The only way to counter it is to trigger the fan to speed 6 (max) through OBD app (Dr Prius).
Anyone here purchased AWD Cruiser in Brisbane lately, looking for some price guide and recommendations on local dealers. Thanks
On Saturday i got the AWD Cruiser hybrid with cargo mat in the Saturn blue for $48500 ��� Motorama Browns plains.I'm not very good at haggling but my general feeling (after walking away) was that a better negotiator could have knocked $1-2k off what I'm getting it for.6 month wait for the car though.
Any idea for GX model waiting time?
Can anyone comment on the pricing for a GXL 2WD Hybrid in WA
We are considering getting a RAV4, although now that's midyear already so we're pondering waiting to see if the 2022 model will have any other/new features.  I assume there would be no benefits to waiting times by doing so (ie, they'd finish making all the orders for 2021 vehicles before starting the 2022 ones?)
I wonder about the 2022 update too. If I order I may miss out on some features or gain some. It a funny gamble. I guess you lock in the price?. Just waiting to finalise loan in the next few days before ordering.
I was also wondering as to what are people thoughts on the whole GFV financing with the Rav4. I havent looked at cars in about 10 years and things have obviously moved on since.Any insights or experiences would be highly appreciated

I guess you lock in the price?Whether you get 2021 or 2022 depends on build time, not order time.Price: My purchase contract basically said that the dealer can change the price at any time, but that I could then cancel if I wanted. Talk to your dealer.
I think production of the 2021 model started in Sep 2020? So I guess if your order is scheduled for production in or after Sep than it should be the 2022 model right?

Hey guys,Have my firstborn due in November, so looking to get some car seat covers for front&rear for what I imagine are inevitable bodily fluids and foodstuffs going where they really shouldn't.Wondering if anyone has any the recommend, bonus if they can be washed? I contacted my local dealer, this is the pricing I got for the standard fabric ones they promote on Rav4 accessories page:Front Fabric seat covers  $371.75 + $44 to fitRear Fabric seat covers $394.24  + $66 to fitSeemed a little steep so thought I'd shop around if others had better luck?
MrsB spilt her gym water bottle on her's (HGXL). A neoprene seat cover kept the seat dry. Canvas or cloth wouldn't. (Note: warm in winter, cool in summer & are washable).
Were you guys able to get a good deal on neoprene custom for Rav4? I like the Wet Seat ones but damn they $$$....
Well, my wait is over. Ordered 2WD Hybrid GXL on 10th May, and received it yesterday. No discount, no extras.Yes, I do know how lucky I am to have managed that outcome.
Dumb question: how does opening the boot work on the Cruiser Hybrid? I can't seem to get the button inside the car to work. I need to switch off the car before the button on the remote or the button on the boot door actually works. Is there a setting here?

Anything build > Aug-20 will have auto fold on Cruiser and Edge only.To open the door card, it's not hard but if you've never done it before, then recommend you don't do it and find someone to do it for you.

Closer to what? Family cars used to cost $25k, then $30k and it���s now more closer to $40k. Soon it���d be $50k and EV will be still around there.

SmellyTofu writes...Soon it���d be $50k and EV will be still around there.What���s a good family ev for 50k ?
EV charging is on the agenda of several apartment tower OCs that I know of. I'm no expert but apparently the technology is capable of rationing the power fed to individual charging outlets so that the system is not overloaded. On one tower the OC is paying for all the central infrastructure with individual owners being charged ($2500 IIRC) for a supply to their parking space.

I have been considering the RAV 4 Cruiser Hybrid as well. Have a very good deal via a neighbour who worked for the particular company I would be buying from. The only problem I have with the Cruiser is that I am about 6 feet 3 inches tall ( 188cm), and with the sun roof in the Cruiser I have to drop the drivers seat right down as low as it can go to get a comfortable driving position. When I sit in the front passenger's seat, which has no height adjustment , my head hits the roof of the car. You would have hoped that they would have at least provided basic height adjustment in the Cruiser. It is about $4000 more than the GLX??Any suggestions, and has anyone else had this problem. I really do like the car. Just one other question, I have read in some reviews that the rear suspension causes some noticeable cabin noise. Is this the case?

Each to their own I suppose. My 2004 RAV4 also had a sunroof, never used it and I don't think I'll use the one in my cruiser. Wish it was an option that could removed, and that Toyota would spend the money on better interior lighting or a better infotainment screen.

There's a discussion on the Facebook RAV4 group about HUD and how people have not ever had a speeding ticket in 28 yrs of driving and that it's a distraction etc etc.In the hands of TMCA product planners, their job is to deliver significant spec differences to differentiate between grades. Sunroof is a "free" (not $ cost but car price is determined by market based pricing, not cost + margin) option not tied together with any other spec since it's a separate wiring harness module generally. From the menu (what they call Vehicle specification sheet) they get given from Toyota Japan, there's not much else they can choose. It's not like TMCA product planners can select LED interior light vs incandescent interior lighting as it's what is engineered across all chassis code for the Australian destination models.

Although Lexus also lags with infotainment, so it's something Toyota generally doesn't do well. The European brands are really a step ahead here with their centre displays and virtual cockpits. That said, having Apple CarPlay means the RAV4 is definitely good enough.

I plastidipped all the badges/emblems on the side and back a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to use HyperDip, but there was no reasonably-priced way to get my hands on it. DipYourCar quoted me $250 just to ship 1 can over to Australia so I just went with PlastiDip.Overall, happy with the final results. The toughest part was using a wooden skewer to pick all the small parts from inside the "Hybrid Cruiser" badge as the gaps were all so minute.It's not perfect, but you wouldn't notice unless you look very closely.I think I'll be taking a bit of a 'break' from working on the car.

Yet they chose to remove the cruise control stalk they've used for 20 yrs that didn't need illumination (up/down, push, pull, press button all had individual actions) and made it worse by making every cruise control function a push button with illumination that spins with the steering wheel.Whilst we're on the subject of stupid ergonomics, the HVAC system is just frustrating as the buttons are small, and TBH, I don't know how many buttons from the left is the fan speed up and down which I know are next to each other. I rarely (never in the 1 yr I've owned it) ever use the climate control and don't ever use the dual zone full stop but whatever, people think it's a good feature and it's in there but annoying to spend way too much time fumbling for the fan up/down switch with eyes off the road.Same with getting CarPlay up on the screen requiring 1 push of the skinny button and a screen press. Why can't I get CP up with a button (and a big button at that given the real estate on the panel)?Then we get to the lower right knee buttons which the location itself is in a position where no one can see without bending down though Toyota/Lexus persist with this in all their cars. Getting back to the buttons located there, why is auto high beam the right most button? Like the power rear door, it's on the left most side which is "easy" to fumble your way across. This means the surround view button should be on the right. It'd be more utilised than switching auto high beam on and off.Fortunately this is fixable though Toyota tries to force installers to fit them in the way Toyota wants you with unique plastic slots for various buttons which is easily hacked off. So now, I have the surround view on the right most side as I use it daily to get out of my tight garage spot with auto high beam next to the power rear door.Anyway, thanks to these ergonomic changes, I am slowly becoming more accustomed to this new setup that I can easily switch brands once my RAV4 is replaced one day. Kinda like how for the life of me can't use Android phones efficiently coz I've been suckered/used to the iOS ecosystem.

Well played TMCA calling out changes THIS early. Pushing back existing (locked in) orders for those calling out "I'm delaying my order" thereby freeing up 2021 stock for new buyers to come in. This will extend the period their order bank they have into this time next year.
From the way the articles are written sounds like there are no changes to be had on the GX base model except maybe some exterior design tweaks and new lights?

If you don't value those things, may as well get this year's model.

Still no hud.. wtf..

Wonder if a genuine Toyoya HUD can be bought/installed as an aftermarket accessory.
This is as close as you are going to get though you need a reflective film put on as regular laminated glass gives you this double image effect. These roughly go for $120 or so on Aliexpress (make sure it's RHD)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxjjHolskVwGenuine, no way as it's a hole in the dash.
I just put an order in today for a Rav 4 Hybrid, and then read about the new model.....  But to be honest the new things dont really sound like changing my order for.Toyota seem to be saying "early 2022" for the new model, with production starting in December 2021.  Hmmm, dont think so.  I've spoke to many dealers and the wait times for the current model Rav4 is early next year for delivery.  So I dont see how the new model can be available at the same time.
Anyone waiting for the PHEV model? Just want to get the forums view on this variant. Still have an older 2010 RAV4 that���s gets all the beating. School drop offs, building materials, towing caravan, 4wd tracks, beaches etc still going strong. Only had to do normal service. But a plug-in hybrid is peaking my interest.
PHEV sounds like more maintenance and hassle for not much gain. Also, in some states, road taxes will end up being higher on PHEVs.
PHV won't be available through the official channels (the strategy would be that PHV would be a Lexus offering). Under the environmental category, they're able to be imported if you're keen (like how the Honda E is able to be imported). Maintenance won't be different. The drivetrain is the same as the Kluger hybrid. The only difference is the traction battery, the attachment pieces and springs (it's 5mm taller).

I've gone back a few pages and haven't been able to find an answer so apologies if I missed it but could someone please tell me the current going price for a 2WD Cruiser Hybrid with non-metallic paint?
I've paid 45650 for Graphite.

We paid $48300 for Cruiser AWD with tow bar and metallic, but that���s QLD, so not sure what the difference in stamp duty is like.
$48300 for Cruiser AWD with tow bar and metallicThat's a great price. I assume it's a hybrid Cruiser? If you don't mind me asking, did you negotiate the price privately or through a broker? Cash or finance?
How much is a Rav4 going for nowadays? (hybrid)Is there much a difference between the Cruiser and the base models?

Really interesting.I haven't experienced a digital rear view mirror myself. But there's a thread on the Rav4 World forums talking about how they don't like that feature as it's really tough on the eyes. Something to do with adjusting your eyes for the depth of view ie. looking through a physical mirror vs looking at a screen-close up.
I think we're talking different things here. The Sorrento has camera that looks out the side the indicator has been selected. The one standard on overseas model (not Au) is in plain English, an-always on camera based centre interior rear view mirror.I'm in 2 minds about them as I'm tempted to buy an aftermarket system from Japan that suits RHD than 90% of them which are LHD biased (i.e. front camera should be closer to the driver). The challenge with them is that your eyes needs to change focus from near to far and back when you're using the display whereas using a regular mirror, you're eyes just needs be at infinity focus (i.e. focused on far objects) as you move your eyes from looking forward to looking back at the mirror.Personally I've not used one to make a decision either way on which is better or not but the use case for using one is there especially if you've got a full load of people / luggage.

Yes, then comes back to the question, why spend the $ to buy and effort installing it?

Where abouts did you find it at 51k?Went in and signed for a 2022 model (Geelong). We were told today to expect to pay $1000-$2500 for the 2022 model and told we will sign in at the highest price until they know better. Deliver is Feb.We weren't given any wiggle room on price, 55k (+$0/-$1500 spending on what the higher ups say) for pearl white and towbar on AWD Hybrid Cruiser. More then what I was expecting, but due to no wiggle room on price, they gave me the best trade win value I could possibly get (no way they will make money on it, I got more for it then I would private) which brings me closer to your 51k, but I'd rather go for 51k base and sell private haha.
Mate if you're fine with FWD jump in right now. You are ULTRA lucky to find one at that price within 1-2 weeks, must be a cancel. Would have a Second thought about it unless you're keen on any extras.
Due to the 6+ month wait times, I've been told to expect the 2022 model with the new upgrades when my RAV4 is delivered. Bought the hybrid GX 2WD, no extras, $40,500 (price fixed for the 2022 model) in northern Sydney.
This spreadsheet may also help you see some of the realistic waiting times. Discussion indicates that Hornsby Toyota seem to have the worst delivery times, as they are selling loads of them at a discount:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qBFC1Ah55f2zgl4TyzT28h40p4CHxPgkeyDkTlL3OQ/edit#gid=0Looks like supply in the short term may in fact improve, as a load of people waiting on 2021 stock are chatting about cancelling so that they can re-order for 2022 stock.

have joined the masses and put an order in for Cruiser AWD.  Just can���t go past that hybrid drivetrain. Delivery could be up to 9 months away!
Just did our first mini road trip from Bris to Sunny Coast and back over the last five days. Five passengers, fully loaded boot, averaging 5.0 per 100km. Only complaint is the wireless charger not consistently charging, depending on phone placement. Will look into it further as phone is usually plugged in

goSPURS writes...im also looking towards the hybrid cruiser...u guys telling me there is a waiting list? lets just u dont care about color, they dont have any floor stock to sell?The list is around 6-9 months but what I���m learning is that it���s quite an old fashioned process based on cars allocated to dealers rather than the customer position in the queue. So you can get different wait times depending on what dealer you buy from even for the exact same spec car as dealers get allocations based on many things.Also asking to be considered for any cancelled order and being flexible on colour could reduce the wait down significantlyThere have been some people who ended up in one in a couple of weeks if all the stars align (e.g a customer ordered black Cruiser was cancelled before delivery and you are the next customer for that dealer who ordered a black one ��� it could go to you even if there have been other buyers of black cruisers waiting for months longer at other dealers )

Hi RAV4 owners, the experience with the infotainment system? From what I used in my test drive, it is not very impressive and could have been better. Has anyone gone for an off market replacemnet or using apple carplay/android auto?
Just use Android Auto or Carplay, it���s more than enough.
Toyota info system is crap.if you are buying GX variant you could save $1000 by deleting sat nav option.

Went and looked at the CHR and Yaris Cross last night. Greta cars but possibly too small, so thinking of saving for a few more months for a RAV4. Anyone in WA care to share their driveway price for a Cruiser Hybrid 2wd? Sticker price is $49,300 from memory.
uggugg writes...Just use Android Auto or Carplay, it���s more than enough.Second that. Add a wireless CarPlay adaptor and that's all you need. You can get live radio & navi via an app. Only thing you can't get around is the poor resolution of the screen and I'm not sure what resolution the screen is at.

Would anyone mind weighing in on 2WD vs AWD for a RAV4 (looking at a GX Hybrid)... it's $3k difference.  I was leaning towards the AWD because maybe one day it might be useful for some trips to Kakadu or Litchfield... but it seems like the 2WD might do the job.

aeon writes...Would anyone mind weighing in on 2WD vs AWD for a RAV4If you are intending to ever tow anything then get the AWD, as the 2WD has an Extremely low maximum towing weight. It's 480kg max braked towing weight. Vs 1500kg for the AWD.
iiman writes...What models have as close to self driving or radar cruise cntrl?All variants of current gen RAV4 have radar cruise with stop/start (via resume button or touch of accelerator pedal when traffic moves) and lane keep assist. But they aren't like a Tesla where you can take your hands off the wheel for long periods. The RAV's LKA will have a cry if you leave your hands off the wheel for longer than about 7 or 8 seconds.
hechesspee writes...AWD works well in wet conditions and never has the spinoff.You're not trying hard enough.Do the same in a Subaru and you won't hear a squeak unless it's got enough power to spin all 4 wheels. Meanwhile in a RAV4, bang bang bang (literally makes those noises) of the system trying to catch the front wheel under full throttle. Basically it's not an ideal setup for traction but is best for efficiency.Snow-wise, I'd wish everyone stop saying it's great in snow. The standard Bridgestone HL33 are just plain old summer economy touring tyres harking back to the Turanza ER33 from 10+ years ago. They have little grip when cold and minimal to zero sips to grip cold/wet surfaces let alone snow. Treat them like slicks in the wet and drive it with respect because the E-four system isn't a magic panacea for all low grip surfaces. What "grip" you think it has is not much more than a 2WD. Remember 2WD have 4 wheel brakes and e-four only gives you the extra method to apply positive motive force (tyres dependant).
Ordered a cruiser hybrid AWD this week. Expected delivery late Feb here in WA.Anyone running a camping fridge in one of these? I hear you can get it into "ready mode" and then lock the car and it will run the engine to keep the main battery charged (which then charges the smaller 12v battery). Anyone doing this on the Australian models?

Apart from that press release. Any rumours on the MY22? I suspect it will look identical to the MY21. Some petrol variants may get different alloys.When the Hilux went from halogen to LED fog lights, the design stayed identical.
Sales person last night told me front lights a little different, something about satnav availability in the GX and I think the crystal pearl becomes frosted white possibly? Doubt it will be much. Selling light hotcakes.
Is the higher towing capacity only useful if you opt in a tow bar?  I can���t see us towing anything any time soon, but I can understand the appeal.
aeon writes...might be useful for some trips to Kakadu or LitchfieldMost of the places you want to get to on a RAV4 can be done with 2WD. The places where you need a true 4WD, you probably won't make it on an AWD RAV4 anyway.

hippyhippy writes...and the difference was night and day.  The car would constantly slip and driving in the wet was actually dangerous.I suspect this would have probably disconnected all traction control as well. So not just AWD related
I have ordered a 2wd Rav4 Cruiser hybrid because i do not plan on going offroad ever. Maybe once a year one day trip to Mt. Buller etc. 99.99% of its life will be spent in the city.I felt the $3000 saved would be better spent on fuel or replacing the hybrid battery after 10 years as i plan to keeping this for a long time.I must confess that I keep debating about changing my order to AWD sometimes.However it appears that the choice of tyres is very important and a 2WD with a very good set of tyres would be as good or better than an AWD with the standard tyres.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atayHQYqA3g
burntoutalready writes...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atayHQYqA3gThat's awesome. Always wanted to know more about that.
I have not really slipped and slided in the wet in my 2WD cruiser.I would say good tyres are more important than AWD if your not off roading
iiman writes...This would be more related to your driving then anything.Probably as stated above.. but could be related to traction control probably turned off ... but it was slipping at very low speeds.  A heavy car on 2wd im sure is good and 4wd is considerably safer.  Worth the premium imho
burntoutalready writes...However it appears that the choice of tyres is very important and a 2WD with a very good set of tyres would be as good or better than an AWD with the standard tyres.This applies to conditions where they have to constantly drive through heavy snow and how many of us do that in Australia (unless you live near snowny mountains)?. Tyres matter, thread on the tyres matter, but the power to all 4 wheels as required also matter. Also, I've never heard people using summer/winter tyres in Australia!
Thanks for the replies about the 2WD vs AWD... it really does sound like I probably don't need 2WD, but I feel like I still want it for no real reason... if not even just for better resale down the track maybe (although it seems there's probably no difference in demand in the market right now).
hechesspee writes...Tyres matter, thread on the tyres matter, but the power to all 4 wheels as required also matter.You can get Yokohama Geolander G015 with 3PMSF in 225/60R18 and 235/55R19 to cover all seasons in all terrain which will be my next tyres when I can wear these eco tyres enough to justify a new set. A set of Nokian or Blizzak is not required unless temps do sit below 7C consistently.Anyway, power to all 4 matter but the system is not designed to be Subaru magic despite the marketing blurb of that magic trail button. Plus who���s allowed to drive in heavy snow? The NPWS just stop everyone at the hint of snow dusting making you chew through the snow chains, chew up the road surface and screw up your car crawling in and out of the snow chain profile.
I go to muddy and sandy farms and currently have an ix35 AWD ��� if it was not for AWD I would have been stuck a few times plus list grip more often. I can���t go back from AWD. I hope the RAV system is good as I am looking to change over to one.
How muddy is muddy? I���ve driven on forestry roads when wet with a thin layer (5 cm thereabouts) of snow several times and it was fine but I put it down to the solid road base forestry roads are known for. Yes the rear axle kicked in heaps and maybe that���s why it was all uneventful but I really doubt it.
Very thick sticky mud. almost got stuck in the AWD. sliding around at 8kms per hour. For me I need it. if your not in those conditions maybe not. I also like the grip in the wet on take off. I drive some 2wd hire cars such as x-trails and they slip an awful lot. For me its hard to go back to a FWD only. The grip is noticeable to me.
hippyhippy writes...4wd is considerably saferJust drive to your and the vehicles limits.
Monkeyfeatures writes...Very thick sticky mud.For sure you���re perfect for 4WD. Just stick all terrains on them given the standard highway economy tyres will not grip in thick mud. The most aggressive tyre I���ve seen that���s closest is 235/60R18 on Dunlop Grandtrek AT5 or standard size 225/60R18 Yokohama Geolander G015.Or else would snow chains suffice in thick mud? Though I���d say removing the chain after going through mud would not be a nice experience without being hosed clean first.
SmellyTofu writes...Just stick all terrains on themWhat's the point? Just get a good allround road tyre?If you're going to the snow, you're taking chains anyhow.You're not going anywhere in a RAV that require AT or MT. You'll be on tarmac 99% of the time and even if you do alot of dirt roads. You'll be competent enough to drive with road tyres (and if you live on a farm, you'll probably have a prado).So. Conclusion.Even in my CX5 I opted for an AWD. Have I ever EVER needed it? No.Have I purposefully taken it to Robe and offroad ��� yes! Did I need the AWD ��� no. Could've been done in any 2wd car.Where's that photo of a SUV stuck in a bog hole in Toolangi ? (family thought it was a capable 4wd) lel
On 2WD v AWD ��� it's interesting watching the energy monitor ��� the battery sends power to the rear wheels pretty much every time you are accelerating off standstill, presumably to maintain traction. So that tells me that AWD is actually being used ��� whether it is making a real difference, dunno.
AT tyres just helps with puncture resistance on gravel roads given I do go on them whenever possible when out of town having been confined to sealed roads in a Prius for 10+ yrs prone to shovelling its nose into any dip in the road. The HL33 gives me zero confidence of its ability to resist these sorts of punctures which means I'm driving at 20-25kmh picking my line to avoid medium sized pointy rocks. Sure I could just keep doing that hence why I'm keeping those eco tyres for now even though there's plenty of 4 for price of 3 offers going on now.Each to their own. Buying a car is rarely a logical & rational decision. I could swing either way to Pilot Sport SUV which would be my "rational" choice for everyday driving but if I'm out of town and see snow (not in the snowy mountains), I'd at least buy myself an opportunity to get out of a hole should I slip into one which I've never had happen yet since my off road driving have been zero in the past 10+ yrs. Do what feels right for yourself. Just don't cheap out on tyres.
Mich��l writes...So that tells me that AWD is actually being used ��� whether it is making a real difference, dunno.In theory it does. The electric motor puts out 121Nm with a 10.781 reduction ratio... thereby being over 1000Nm at the rear axle vs front that outputs 728Nm at the axle (plus the torque from the petrol motor)Going back to the efficiency of 2WD vs 4WD, depending on who you believe, the WLTP rating of 18.1km/L vs 19.4km/L in city cycle is massive compared to the UNECE aligned, ADR version.
Out of curiosity, does the service cost of AWD come at a premium over 2wd?
Only if you need the rear motor trans fluid replaced which should not be required according to the book. The MGR (Motor Generator Rear) doesn���t have any coolant, so short answer, no difference.

Anyway, if your bikes obstruct visibility of the rear lights, you'll need a light panel anyway or else you're risking a fine at the police's discretion.

The MY22 update is predicted to be a $1,200 to $2,500 price increase depending on model. But it���s a guess until pricing revealed in October/NovemberI���m hoping the 90s era screen resolution is fixed!
Bell writes...I���m hoping the 90s era screen resolution is fixed!Would be nice, but I don't think so. Dealers had a list of changes, and no mention of changes to cameras or screen (apart from digital rear view mirror in the cruiser)
SmellyTofu writes...Unfortunately, plugging a trailer doesn't "kill" the rear sensorsThat���s a shame. Apparently older models had an isolator switch in the rear door or boot which would turn off the rear parking sensors.At this point I just have to press ���Ok��� on the steering wheel to mute the alarms whenever I shift into reverse...

Anyone heard of the Mineral Blue potentially becoming a Rav4 colour? I would be keen to change my order to that if it comes.
SmellyTofu writes...Only if you need the rear motor trans fluid replaced which should not be required according to the book. The MGR (Motor Generator Rear) doesn���t have any coolant, so short answer, no differenceMany thanks, good to know.
Bell writes...Thats not too bad, but yeah Im sure there is a solution somewhereThe counter to this the designers at TMCA would have though is that there's a sound cancel function already so disabling the sensors is not necessary for bike holders. Also the sensors would help say when you're backing up a trailer and you'd get additional warning before it jack knifes into your bumper giving you an additional audio warning.
Is the current rav4 2021 model that is on the totes website different from the 2022 model? I���m hearing people here say the 2022 model has some different specs or is the 2022 model already the one on the Toyota website?
See whrl.pl/Rgh7HtI believe the Toyota website is showing the 2021 model.

New to this thread, but My partner is looking at a gxl/cruiser at the moment. We were told 1000/2500 price increase for fy22 for petrol/hybrid respectively. No hybrid allocation until December so with a Price hike. Price on website won't update until Dec which I thought was odd.
chapstik writes...Price on website won't update until Dec which I thought was odd.I think it is odd as I want to be able to lock in the best price possible but having a grey areas does not help me do that���.  Will start talking to dealers in the next few weeks or maybe a broker���.

Can the cabin filter be improved? I think the filter or setup used is rubbish as you often smell exhaust or odours from outside, such as, shopping strips, etc.Compared to my previous car, you would not smell any of that stuff.
Rendog writes...In this market that is a pretty good deal!Basically a price match. One of the member of Rav4 2021 FB group posted a comment on thread after bargaining for this price. I went to the same dealership and asked sales person if you can match, and he did the usual drama of no and all. Finally walked into manager cabin and they matched it.Silver Moon writes...2021It's 2021.

Anyone have a nudge bar, do you like it?
Hi ya'll I'm looking at getting a GXL AWD hybrid.My question is ��� if I order now I'll have to wait to close to 2022 to get the 2022 which is fine.Though if I lock in a price. One dealer said I'd have to pay the difference to the new model (could be $500 could be more (we know it's $2500).I would've thought If you negotiate a price it'll be that price?Is this common or a sales trick?
iiman writes...One dealer said I'd have to pay the difference to the new model (could be $500 could be more (we know it's $2500).My contract (for a 2021 RAV4) said I'd have to pay the difference if the price went up and I still wanted to buy. That seems to be normal practice.  If you have negotiated a discount then you can expect that discount to still apply if the price goes up.
Yes our GXL Hybrid has a black nudge bar fitted to it.   I like it as it changes the shape of the front end of the car, makes it a little bit different from other Rav4 out there
iiman writes...we know it's $2500Do we really? Its what one or two dealers have said, but the Cruiser has more new stuff on the 2022 model than the GX and GXL, so that may be for the Cruiser. At this stage I would not be committing to paying $2500 extra if it will be the 2022 model, but at most I would allow whatever the publicly stated increase is as the time gets closer. It may be $1500 extra on a GXL, who knows?
iiman writes...I would've thought If you negotiate a price it'll be that price?Is this common or a sales trick?It appears legit.

In my case, the $2.5K is worth it, just for the passenger seats, as long as they are height adjustable.The issue of poor headroom in the passenger seat was a deal breaker for me, despite loving everything else about the RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid over repeated test drives.I want the Toyota hybrid drivetrain, so the obvious solutions to that issue was a 2nd hand Lexus NX300h that has noticeably more passenger side headroom due to the height adjustable seats.However, a 3 year old Lexus costs about the same as a new RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid, has done 50-80K kms, will depreciate very quickly since a new model is about to come out, costs more to service, has the dodgy Lexus trackpad interface, has slightly 'look-at-me' styling that I am not really a fan of, is slower, heavier and less fuel efficient, and is based on the previous generation platform.  (Hey, this is a tech forum, we want the latest tech right?!?)Tempted to go for the new AZ20 NX350h, but that is likely to be ~$15K more than the Toyota, with 1 year less warranty...So, yes, it is completely worth it for me. :)
When you start looking at lexus.. you're in tesla territory. I'll take the tesla over the toyota I think
hippyhippy writes...When you start looking at lexus.. you're in tesla territory. I'll take the tesla over the toyota I thinkI went around this circle 3 times���If I want a Tesla I want the M3LrP so that���s pushing 80k,The Lexus is in that $60k+ mark.Rav 4 was in that mid $40k range (ended up with a cruiser so closer to $50k).My criteria is 1. Least depreciation 2. Least amount of fuel usage.For this reason I ruled out the Lexus (relatively high depreciation)Same with the Tesla ��� it���s still early days with the M3 whiles prices are going up in the states they are dropping here. As they get older and we see how they are after 2-3 years that���s when I���ll jump on. Also saw a good article was about 12% dep for a TeslaCompared to 4% with the RAV4
There's never been a rational financial reason to buy luxury cars full stop. If you're money savvy (appears you are iiman), then RAV4 (or any regular SUV) would be your pick if you must buy a car.I used to price Toyota/Lexus back in the day and Lexus always had at least 30% mark up as a starting point because:1) The market can sustain it2) The Germans are doing it too
I think Tesla is far better value than the RAV4 but it���s more expensive, so out of my price range.
Bell writes...I think Tesla is far better valueI agree a bit more car there, but it's the ownership cost 2-3 years down the track all things considered.That's also the sweetspot when I'd like to enter the tesla market.
Bell writes...I think Tesla is far better value than the RAV4 but it���s more expensive, so out of my price range.No not really... your talking a car that costs 50% more ... for the ravs price range it's pretty much number 1.  But in tesla price range it's the best.Value is up to the buyer I guess.
I���ve ordered a RAV4 and test drove the Model 3. The RAV4 feels about 20 years old in comparison. The RAV4 is very good but the Tesla is on a whole other level. At high 50s on road (after rebate) the Model 3 is very good value especially with that level of performance. Of course all my opinion which doesn���t mean much.But RAV4 is the better car for my uses and budget.

I just pulled my order, as the price we agreed on included the price increase. Dealer sends contract has it written subject to price increase for the 2022 upgrade.So yeah opted not to pay $1.5~$2.5k extra
iiman writes...o yeah opted not to pay $1.5~$2.5k extraYeah 2.5K is a bit rich of an increase
iiman writes...opted not to pay $1.5~$2.5k extraI thought you said earlier that it was '$700-$800 for the GXL' extra for the 2022 model, or did you you change your choice to the Cruiser?But I understand that you did not want to pay extra when the agreed price included the price increase.
