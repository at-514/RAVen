"New one on Drive looks..interesting.Toyota's new design language is taking shape. Odd shapes! The rear tail-lights and overall shaping takes on new VW Tiguan looks, the front is a mashup of current RAV4, Hyundai Tucson and a bit of the Ford Echo.Interior looks bland apart from interesting shape of the – cupholder! That's about all I can say. Though the detailing around the air vents on the dash looks nice-ish and the 'pockets' in the lower dash areas look original and useful.",2018-Mar-28,whrl.pl/Re7BHK

Don’t let that be a deterrent.And the new KF CX5 is essentially a new dress. Under the bonnet has hardly changed- a few tweaks here and there.The RAV 4 will be good, but Toyota are about the only  jap company that are behind or lacking in most safety tech. Base models lack a lot compared to rivals and are usually severely over priced for what you get.

"sunmax2 writes...Mind sharing here? Are you a dealer btwNo not a dealer – run carloop. Here are some tips:- It's always good to know what other owners are paying so you have something to stand on (you can ask here on WP or request a report from carloop)- Check dealership stock on their websites (if they have it in stock, they would want to move it as quickly as possible – hence a better deal for you)- Buying closer to the end of the month helps as some dealers might be behind their sales targets- As for negotiation, first negotiate a price without accessories. Then talk to them about throwing a few in (mats, tank of fuel etc.)- Get offer from one dealer and then use it as a starting point for dealing with other dealers (preferably those in the outer suburbs/regional areas)- If you have a trade in, try and sell that car privately (there is a big market for it and you would get much more than you would from the dealers).Hope it helps.",2019-Mar-2,whrl.pl/Rfj9JH

I googled that it has a range of about 30km, that would do me on a lot of my day to day stuff.Dunno where you got that 30km from.For starters, these are not like PHEV vehicles. There's no specific range for EV only operation. Generally, with a full charge, in forced EV mode you'll get 1-2km and then EV mode will cancel and the ICE will start. Accelerating too hard or going over about 40-45km/h will cancel it also.If you have a full charge and you're cruising at around 60-70km/h on a flat road, backing off for a moment will drop the ICE and run on EV only (as indicated by the EV lamp in the cluster). If you gently accelerate to keep the momentum going, you'll get around 2 or 3km on EV before the ICE has to kick in when the HV battery gets low.It takes a bit of practice and a few changes to driving habits, but once you master it, you'll find your fuel economy gets better and better.",2019-May-14,whrl.pl/RfmJml

"Wasn't told anything about running in the engine and I had to do a trip to Sydney  (400 k's return).

I reckon the AWD has noticeably more torque off the line. I guess it should as the rear motor is rated around 90Nm. AWD also has a ""trail mode"" button for off-road which I don't think is in the 2WD versions. I owned 2 Mazda FWD cars before and didn't like them at all in the wet, especially over painted surfaces at intersections.There are a few interior details I noticed that depart from the GXL apart from the seat fabric & steering wheel, like hard plastic inner door handle grips in the GX, no center vent closing thumb wheel things. There's probably a few more things that I'll find as I go but they don't really bother me. GX Hybrid you have to lock/unlock the doors with the keyfob but its not needed to start the car. Visually the interior is more or less the same as the GXL. The smart entry on the GXL you still have to touch an area on the door handle to lock it. The dealer told me you cant walk away and have it lock automatically (like my Ute)The only thing I think they should have put on the GX is a better steering wheel.

Bit frustrated, as I was hoping to be able to use it in winter (gets rough and dangerous around here)… I heard too due to the popularity of this model that an embargo has been put on it, so staff are unable to order one using their staff discount for some 6 months from release date.Does anyone have a reputable source or an article on the delays at the factory, and why this is? I'm not even sure if the factory is the one/s in Japan or Canada.

Didnt go any other accessories or options.Would have been approx $2000 more for the hybrid.Coming from an ancient car with zero features this one is like a spaceship and the main reason I went Toyota over Honda and the other brands was the base model basically includes everything practical in the safety features and is only really missing luxury stuff which I dont need or really want =P Drives nice and smooth and very little cabin noise.Can also confirm the large back side windows appear to be tempered glass according to the writing on them and the little triangles of side glass appear to be UV protected glass so tinting might be a good idea if you are worried about skin cancer either at the dealer or elsewhere. Looks exactly the same as the privacy glass after tinting so not even sure why anyone would want privacy glass over just tinting windows when it provides less benefit.If its your first car and you dont need the luxury stuff do consider the GX base model if you want to save cash for something else more important it seems to do basically everything I need but I am not spoilt by upgrading from a new car so keep that in mind. If you wanted a hybrid the GX one did seem to have some more features than the base GX.

The fact that the 2019 model looks tons better than the last model also helped a lot.Yeah Miracast only works when the car is in park which is pretty much pointless. The Satnav is similar that you cant use it while the car is in motion but if its at a full stop even in drive it lets you enter destinations.

"Just test drove the GX 2wd Hybrid.Colour me impressed. Some quick thoughts:Exterior – looks even better in real life. The car is more ‘substantial’ than I was expecting.Interior – I wouldn’t call it classy at all, but it seems to be high quality and put together well. In a word I’d call it rugged.Drive – it’s very quiet. I didn’t even notice when the petrol engine kicked in. It is quite peppy and had no issues with acceleration. Steering felt fine.Features – with a couple of annoying exceptions, the GX Hybrid has everything I’m after. Unfortunately it doesn’t have a proximity key for unlocking the doors (how isn’t this standard on every new car?) and although the mirrors fold in, it’s not automatic and requires a button to be pushed.

Never had the TPMS go off on the tires with nitrogen. There are naysayers out there, but nitrogen stays in the tyres longer than air unless there is a leak through the tyre or valve. It does cost $6/tyre, so the usual response is air is free etc. I like it. But admit haven't bothered in the other Golf since having new tyres fitted. Free pressure checks for the life of the tyres, so not a big expense.Just need to let the dealer/service centre know at service time not to check the pressure, as putting air in sort of defeats the purpose of nitrogen.

Lower pressure with the result being more flex in sidewalls and therefore increase heat and potentially tyre failure is a great reason for TPM's.I think for those that don't regularly check tyre pressures and servos don't check as per 50 years ago, I hope they become standard equipment in the near future.The RAV4 not having the safety feature is not a deal breaker as you can always get a 3rd party TPM, but wait a year or two and I am sure it will become Std on all Toyota's.",2019-Jun-11,whrl.pl/RfnJqk

"acacer writes...You only have to look at the respective Toyota websites.As someone that used to do this very thing for a living for this very manufacturer, it's not just a matter of ""we're a 1M market so we get nothing"" and consider things like commonalities in regulations, factory capacity not only overall but also within each bay to build the variations, wiring harness combinations, engineering developments considerations for the various destination etc.The last one in particular to note coz Australia is seen as a harshest destination in the world (probably eased a bit since I've left but always been harsher than US rightly or wrongly) hence you don't always get the largest wheels, the panoramic sunroof etc other markets get. All those factors are taken into considerations where the output of this are the restrictions mandated by Japan.Sure bag on the product people all you like but it's not coz of the lack of trying sometimes.",2019-Jun-14,whrl.pl/RfnOj8

"WhatThe writes...they can be built any which way as they come down the lineFinal build model is determined before the chassis is even placed on the line.  For efficiency, manufacturing has to have everything 'line up' as the car moves through the process.   For example, models with a sunroof to be fitted on day 3 of the process would have the sunroof in a cue potentially up to a week before hand (likely less for JIT purposes).  Assemblers / robots need the exact part to go on the exact car, at the exact time.Production manufacturing would never say 'Hey, this ones got a hole in the roof, where'd you put that piece of glass thingy?'They'd know (Toyota) days / weeks / very likely a month or more in advance exactly which model on what day and even what time the manufacturing will happen.BTW, there can never be ""Delays in Manufacturing"" – other than critical parts shortages, which in today's car industry would be avoided at all costs due to the penalties that (in this case) Toyota would make the supplier pay.  It's not worth it to any car manufacturer supplier to ever be late delivering parts.  I've known suppliers that are normally a single shift move to 3 shifts (24hrs / day) over a long weekend to avoid paying penalties.'Delays in Manufacturing' usually means that someone else (somewhere in the RHD market world) paid more than we did and they took the car that we ordered (as it was an exact match), and ours had to be re-ordered.   Commonly known as 'being bumped'.",2019-Jun-14,whrl.pl/RfnOtx
"is this hearsay or is it something you know from being in there?Just google some European Toyota sites.Here we have 3 models, each one either petrol or hybrid. If hybrid, then choose 2WD or 4WD.

Eg 2l petrol version can have 4WD, cruiser equivalent can have panoramic roof, heated steering wheel etc. I'm not saying they are good options, but would be nice to have them here, especially Cruiser with a panoramic roof. Best look at the UK site – no petrol, all hybrids.

"WheelsWhat's the best mid-size family SUV?By Byron Mathoudakis, 20 Jun 2019 Comparisonshttps://www.whichcar.com.au/reviews/comparisons/2019-mid-size-suv-comparisonComing to a boilThat’s why, for the first time in over a decade, a RAV4 wins a Wheels comparison. Not by much, for the Forester’s core attributes – bar-raising comfort, vision, safety and value – remain, but the Toyota hybrid is always close behind in all these and ahead in cargo space while offering palpably better performance and even better fuel economy. When the petrol-electric Subaru arrives, the order may reverse.For different reasons, a similarly minuscule gap separates the charming Mazda and ripsnorting Volkswagen, but the CX-5 offers greater consistency. The Tiguan soars with searing speed, efficiency and packaging, but prices itself perilously close to luxury alternatives.",2019-Jun-21,whrl.pl/Rfn3tA

The car would have over 100km on the odo, how is it still a new car...I'd have thought that they will send it by truck...You are correct that they will send some young punk who will try to get to you in the soonest, meaning no care at all on the way to you. An inspection by you prior to accepting delivery will not reveal what he did to your motor on the way to your place. I get that every motor is run in prior to shipping, but this doesn’t protect you from the careless delivery driver in a rush – it’s not just the motor, it’s the way they might treat everything else e.g driving in reverse and then putting the gear into drive and slamming on the accelerator right away without any time for the gears to properly engage – best way to wear a new gearbox – these guys do these deliveries every day – to them it’s just another car they will never see.Let your instincts guide you. Personally I would call the dealership and ask if they are able to put it on a truck for free – if not then ask how much extra – it should not be the full cost of trucking as they have already allowed for the punk’s time to drive the car to you and get back to work.

"Hi Jason. Assuming the system hasn't changed in the last 12 months and I don't believe it has, Web tracking relies on 2 pieces of information and one action by the dealer. You need the batch number from Toyota Australia (TA) and the retail sales order number that the dealer creates on TA's computer system. Once created the dealer has to then flag the sales order for web tracking. The sales order and the batch number are the user code and password. The web site is https://webapps.toyota.com.au/apps/cwt/. The problem occurs when vehicles are in short supply. Dealers tend to not create the retail orders until they have confirmed production.  They don't know exactly how many vehicle by grade & colour etc they will get from a particular months production until production is confirmed. (this occurs around the 3rd of the month for the next month ie August Production, September arrival should have just been confirmed). A dealers allocation is based on a ""fair share"" system taking into consideration their sales history, market share, Prime Market Area volume and the mix of grade available from TMC Japan. Just because a dealer has an order from you for a vehicle there is no guarantee they will get it from TA. That's when they swap with other dealers. If its before the vehicle arrives on the wharf it's a paper swap and after that a physical swapping of vehicles. Also if a dealer is only getting 5 vehicles and has 15 retail orders which 5 will he fill this month? My bet would be the ones with the biggest profit in them or ""loyal"" repeat customers. Web tracking is only useful for an order on production or on a ship. After that all it will show you is that it is at the dealer.",2019-Jul-4,whrl.pl/RfowKc

"Hi Jason. Sorry I should have checked on your location. Western Australia is different. – It has an independent Distributor (TWA) with it own computer system – Not Toyota Australia. To the best of my knowledge web tracking does not work and never has for WA deliveries. If  you have a batch number the dealer should be able to tell you the ship name and the port ETA. You can then track the ship on web sites like marine traffic – https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:162.8/centery:-13.2/zoom:3. From memory ships leave Nagoya every Friday night for Australia with 2 ships per month for WA . Steaming time was 19 days then allow 3 days to clear wharf and then 1- 6 days for off wharf processing and a further 1- 3 days for delivery to a metro dealer. If you have a VIN then it means it is already on a ship. (Up until that point VINs will not have been allocated to an order on production). I have tried to keep it simple but  as you can see there are lots of variables in the shipping process so Dealers are very reluctant to give a firm ETA – (Under promise / over deliver) . There are at least another 7 to 10 factors that can effect delivery times even before you throw in things like bad weather, port congestion, strikes etc. WA Dealers do get real time status updates as it moves along the supply chain.",2019-Jul-5,whrl.pl/Rfoyh4

"Brissie writes...I’m interested in a hybrid, and I have a few questions:1. is it worth getting the AWD model for $3k more?I bought a GX hybrid AWD and drove the GXL FWD hybrid at the dealers. I couldn't really tell too much of a difference between them driving normally but I didn't drive them back to back. My AWD does really get up and go when you plant it though. The best thing is for you to test drive yourself. I chose the AWD because I thought it may be safer and better to drive in wet weather. I had a couple of FWD cars before that would spin the front wheels easily when taking off from lights in the wet and up steep hills.  I read Somewhere that the rear motor in the AWD is 40kW so I guess it must add a bit of torque3. What is the difference between the reverse camera in the GXL and the one in the GX?The GXL has guide lines that move with the wheels i.e. to show your trajectory. I find them confusing but I think you can turn them off. GX has fixed guidelines.4. Is it worth getting the GXL?GX has a few differences not listed in the spec sheet (not sure they are in the GXL or Cruiser but definitely not in the GX such as – black plastic interior door handles, no center vent closing thumb wheel thingys, no coin tray in center console (!), no boot accessory socket. That's about it from what I can see apart from the obvious things like leather steering wheel, keyless entry & privacy glass etc.  GX Hybrid also gets the climate control and keyless start, so its not all bad.You need to work out whether the $ for the extra bling is worth it. All of the safety features & tech are pretty much the same across the range so I didn't really see the value in spending the extra money.

Vyviel writes...Yeah I am not sure why people need a SUV that they can floor off the lightsBetter acceleration also translates into faster and therefore safer overtaking on highways when road-tripping with the family.It also translates to better grip when accelerating from a standstill and out of tight corners in the wet.Likewise less chance of losing control on gravel and less chance of getting bogged when pushing the limits of soft-off-roading (which can also apply to school and sport pick-up/drop-off in muddy/sandy/mulched ground after jumping a big curb that others couldn't/wouldn't to find a place to park).SUV's definitely have a different use-case to hatchbacks if you get one with decent clearance and AWD: They become more than just a heavier and more expensive version of the hatch they're based on but with a taller driving position. They start to bridge the gap between 4WD wagon and hatch (which was originally the whole point of them).,2019-Jul-8,whrl.pl/RfoCXZ

"richardJF writes...It's been demonstrated that the RAV4 AWD system does very little during hard acceleration from a standing start.That was the previous generation.This generation is infinitely more effective (because the old one did virtually nothing).Check out the Youtube page which does ""roller tests"". They do a back-to-back comparison of the old and the new. The 2019 hybrid AWD is able to climb out of 2x front wheel rollers using the rears (whereas the old model couldn't). You can also see the rears spinning almost all of the time at a similar speed to the fronts when they put the rollers on the sides (whereas the old model didn't even spin the rears most of the time).There's another Youtube video showing how the system works when accelerating at speed around a gravel corner. The hybrid doesn't provide as much power at the rear as the mechanical AWD equipped ""Edge"" version, but it still is noticeable (unlike the previous version).AWD doesn't provide any extra driving safety in onroad situations.This is completely wrong. Simply put, for the same level of torque output, AWD vehicles have less torque going to any individual wheel, which means it is harder for that vehicle to break traction and potentially lose control during acceleration. Yes ESC/ESP/TC will intervene is such a situation, but sometimes that's too late.FYI I have owned both a FWD turbo vehicle and full-time AWD turbo vehicle. If I tried to accelerate out of corners in my FWD as quickly as I used to in my AWD I would be leaving the road, even with all of the various systems doing their best to keep me on it.

I have read that if most of the trips are very short (less than 5 km), there is not much fuel saving with the hybrid when the engine and fluids are still being warmed up.Camry hybrid owner here.My answer is that it depends on how cold it is and how hard you start driving straight away. If you start the car then hop on the freeway it is going to be warmed up pretty quickly. This is a very non technical view but I think most cars like the temperature gauge to sit at 50%, whatever that may be, and the software will control the car to cool or heat to keep it sitting there.Keep in mind though that the process of warming up itself will generate electricity which is stored in the battery and which can be used by the car later, so you get a loss when you transfer the energy from Organic (Petrol) via combustion to kinetic  and via generation back to electrical, but the energy after that percentage loss is used by the hybrid system later (with another loss when it is transferred to kinetic energy via the electric engine)The Hybrid wont be powered by electricity only until the car is comfortable that it is sufficiently warm AND the desired acceleration is low AND there is sufficient or excess energy in the battery.",2019-Jul-9,whrl.pl/RfoEhe

"Brissie writes...So perhaps it only comes on during full acceleration or when there is a slip with the front wheels?Yea that's right. Hard acceleration and front slip. Also the trail button is meant to activate it more often and more aggressively (among other changes).But I don’t get why the 4WD has only 3 additional KW compared to the 2WD when it has an additional 40kw motor in the rear.My guess is that the battery is already at its max discharge rate (battery longevity and heat generation). So for the most part it is diverting power that would have gone to the front and sending it to the rear.The quicker time may be due to the FWD version holding back some of the torque as it gets off the line (very common these days in high power cars) to maintain traction (it does have ~425Nm combined, hence the need for a mechanical LSD), whereas the AWD diverts some of that torque to the rears and hence doesn't need restricting off the line to keep the fronts under control.

I paid in late June, the sales told me it might be built in AugustOriginally, I ordered 3 days after launch (GXL 2WD Hybrid) and was given an August build projection.  Nothing was confirmed for weeks, despite constant requests.I then received an email saying that the production problems (braking regen?) were mainly to do with the 2WD and my production date was pushed to November!  Obviously not happy, the dealer I was with 'just wondered' if the AWD H was an option (in my colour) as they had one of those on the way.   I raised the issue of the ridiculous waiting times for the ordered car and expected a 'great deal' on the incoming stock option.The dealer stepped up!  Not only did I get (IMO) about $2K more for my trade than I expected but an additional $2K off the RRP for the GXL AWD H.  I only asked for the mats and the boot mat (which is really top quality too BTW).Having driven only 500km so far, it's obviously not a completely 'informed' opinion, but I'm loving it.  Who knew radar cruise was a God send?  Lane keep assist takes some getting used to, but it's amazing as well.  I haven't owned a CVT before, even though this is my 23rd car.  I'm impressed! Although, I'm coming most recently from a KL Cherokee 3.2L and that was the worst car I've ever owned.  Never, ever again.

I'm still on the original tank of fuel with an estimated 380km remaining.  So the target will be between 850 and 900k's for the tank.

Automatic High Beam is accurate and brilliant.  The room in the back is outstanding for the size.  Again, smashes the Jeep out of the park.  Headroom, Leg room and the rear seats recline and lock in just enough too in case someone wants to have a nap.I can not relate to anyone's problem with noise inside the cabin.  Maybe all of my 22 other cars (6 of which were new) were just noisy buggers.  The Rav is probably one of the quietest cars I've had.  I'm looking forward the Android Auto / CarPlay update towards the end of the year, but this will be a bonus as I've got everything I need anyway with the system the way it is.I've not 'scored' a car before, but for comparative purposes if the Jeep was a generous 4, then the Rav is easily an 8 – 9.

On the other hand if you follow all instruction and something bad still occurs, then you know solely where the blame lies. Same goes for buying new vs. used, and for getting it properly serviced. I've had repairs covered well beyond warranty thanks to this.

"mpk- writes...You’re kidding right??? Dealers must love youLol. Dealers must love YOU.Skimming is about 2/3 the cost of new rotors + install. Rotors aren't expensive; labour is. We're talking about ~$100 difference for a pair to avoid the below.When skimmed you take already worn rotors and take additional material taken off. They now have a limited life remaining. Also they often stuff up the skimming process, meaning the disks will wear unevenly as will your pads, resulting in both having a greatly reduced lifespan.Then when your thin and possibly unevenly worn rotors need replacing, your new brake pads will now need to be skimmed down as well (more labour costs), and you open yourself up to the same above issues but this time for your pads (that will soon need to be replaced anyway, meanwhile they wear unevenly on your new rotors).In the long-term, it's cheaper and less drama to just do them at the same time.I've heard this straight from a service managers mouth when talking about his daughters car when he dropped me back home, having had the rotors skimmed only to need them replaced shortly after at a different manufacturers dealership (the other dealership recommend skimming – when he found out he was furious), and I had the exact same thing happen personally as his own dealership (they had to replace the skimmed rotors with new ones free of labour costs as they were wearing unevenly on the new pads – they stuffed up).",2019-Jul-25,whrl.pl/RfR3X9

"So here's some relevant and current data for readers.I signed yesterday (24/7/19) at my local (Sydney based) Toyota dealer for a new RAV4. Cruiser Hybrid 2WD + metallic paint (saturn blue) + Nutmeg interior + floor mats+ cargo mat (mats = $209).Specced on the Toyota website drive away this is $46,767.Went to a bunch of brokers + financiers who claimed they could beat down the price. Best offer from them after a fortnight of drip-fed ""we're still waiting for a few to come back"" was $44,852 (Δ $1915 or 4.1% off RRP, coupled to 6.7% finance as a novated lease). The offered explanation was ""new model, contained stock, zero motivation to discount from dealers"".Compare this to Mazda who jumped at the chance to drop 10% off the RRP for a Touring CX-5, and who had the right colour in stock, drive away within a week, when I test drove one a week earlier.A hard decision. But frankly, the Mazda didn't excite me as much as I thought it would, despite the steeper discount and availability.Eventually I went back to my local Toyota dealer who had effectively sold me on the RAV and asked for $44,650 (4.5% off the retail), and 4.98% finance (the best I had seen elsewhere) as a novated lease, improving on the 5.2% finance they had originally offered. They said yes. The establishment costs of Toyota finance and the annual management fee were as good as most of the other quotes I received. I felt a hunch there was yet more room to move but I based my offer on the best brokered price I got and deducted another $200. My reasoning was that if a glut model (eg CX-5) has a margin of 10% and most brokered quotes on the RAV hovered around 5% off RRP, then that's around their comfort level. I still wonder if I should have put an offer of $44K neat.Having inked the deal, I am informed the *build* date will be 15-Oct, plus the ship time on top of that. Adding a month for freight, that's 3 and a half months for a factory order.Hope this helps.",2019-Jul-25,whrl.pl/RfR4xi

That said not end of the world if we don't as we still have our current CX 3One other question as I just had a follow-up call from the dealership. I am getting a cam Blackvue, that is agreed but they tried to sell us permaguard. We already have a tint included in our price so this is for the paint protection and the leather protection. Is it something worth considering or just a bit of extra margin for the dealership with no added benefit for the car? Did anyone get it?",2019-Jul-29,whrl.pl/RfTckp
I dunno but the dealer I went through seemed pretty honest he said the cam was overpriced and better to just get one installed somewhere else for cheaper when I asked about it =P,2019-Jul-29,whrl.pl/RfTctT

Hi have been on to my dealer about my car. Said there was nothing yet but has said that he has a white one available that I can get if I want it. Not too sure as I was getting a blue one. What should I do?,2019-Aug-9,whrl.pl/RfTyN9
"the_rats_girl writes...What should I do?If it's exactly the same other than the color, I'd be jumping all over it.  The car is definitely worth having sooner rather than later (IMO).  A white one (I think) should be that little bit cheaper too, maybe use that for some accessories or pocket the difference.Personally, I've halved my fuel bill for the month and it's wonderful to drive.  Waiting for a particular color might be preferable but in all honesty, a white one will hold it's value just that little bit better in the future being considered a 'neutral' colour.If you don't have tracking available or a confirmed production date, then the wait times can still blow out.  Some are quoting 6 months now from buying to expected delivery date.  I was in the same boat as you when my dealer offered me a slightly different variant that he had in stock.  My only difference was I ordered a 2WDH GXL and they had an AWDH GXL.I was even able to negotiate on the price, which was really difficult / hardly anything with the one on order.",2019-Aug-9,whrl.pl/RfTyVD

"Hey all,Picked up my AWD GXL last weekend – have to comment that it does drive like a dream! I've not had much chance to drive it, but so far few small things I've observed:PROS:- Hybrid is sooooo damn cheap to run... My last car was built 1998, so it's a 20+ year jump in vehicles models for me- I live/breathe tech, so this car and the features is right up my alley – particularly driver assist- The Eco score and monitoring is helpful – it gives you a rating at the end of your drive, so my partner and I have a competition of sorts going on- Keyless entry/start is amazing – although it is initially quite weird not knowing if the car is running once started (no noise/vibration that I'm used to)-Looks are absolutely smashin' compared to the previous model; I originally wanted a Rav4 after seeing how the older models look like mini Landcruisers, but I'm happy for the sporty trade-off-Regardless of how many others got the same color – Crystal Pearl looks wonderful compared to plain white. Yes, I know any repairs will be costly – but given this is my first new car (and how much I paid for it), I might as well get *exactly* what I wanted- Car came at least a month before the projected date – I ordered late May- Separate heating/cooling temps for driver and passenger aircon – no more battling there- Boot: flipping the boot cover over from the fabric side to the plastic(?) side – saved needing to buy a boot mat (I guess?)CONS:- The wireless charging dash area has what looks like grippy material in it, but as I live in the country I'm finding my phone is slipping around a lot and therefore coming off charge a lot; I'm going to be trying a different type of phone case, and if that fails I might just put a tiny blob of silicone in there for grip- No dash light in the glovebox. I'm yet to finish reading the instruction manual but that seems pretty pov for a mid-tier build- I sincerely hope they can allow a toggle for that annoying school reminder to only occur during the required hours- Driving out of my house in the country, it's a few minutes until you hit your first speedsign; this does seem to frustrate my car a little, who will remind you to stick to local laws/regulations the moment you go over 60km/h (country limit is a typical 100km/h)-I was planning on using that Rav4 $500 deal... Was a little annoyed as the dealer had my car on the last day of the deal (July 31st), however I didn't receive my car until 2 days later – meaning I missed the deadline, in no less part due to the multitude of build delays. I have written to Toyota customer service to see if it can be backdated but I'm not too optimistic on that-Would definitely like to see the mirrors auto-fold when car is turned offI'll come back and give some more hints as I find more stuff...Now I'm looking forward to the Android retrofit – however I was wondering if it were possible to have both the Android and Apple system fit and just switch between the 2 as needed?",2019-Aug-9,whrl.pl/RfTzbc

It drives great (though getting used to the LTA which seems to be quite aggressive) and looks amazing.So far noticed the following things that I'm not entirely happy with;- Lack of Automatic Locking Retraction (ALR) for the rear seat belts meaning child seat fitting is more difficult. I have a 6mth – 8yr old seat (top of the range and brand new) that doesn't have ISOFIX so this means I was relying on the ALR for safer mounting.- Have to work out how to stop the ""follow road regulations"" warning when near speed limit. This was activating at 58km/hr when speed limit was 60km/hr (and signs were detected). - Cruise control seems to want to stick at 1km/hr below the set speed. Not a big deal but I set the speed limit for a reason – my Outback with dynamic cruise didn't do the same.Will go for a few drives over the weekend and report back if I find anything else but very happy with the purchase!Fuel economy in first 90km has been about 6.1L / 100km with mostly highway speeds with a little bit of peak hour crawl.",2019-Aug-16,whrl.pl/RfTLNh

"I ordered my Saturn Blue 2WD Cruiser Hybrid on 24/7 and received contract paperwork saying build ""mid October"" and delivery around ""31/10"".I called my Sydney dealer this morning with the anecdotal evidence that many people having ordered in May/Jun/July are now being told of delays, and worried that now I'm within a month of the putative build date, the online portal still lists no build month estimate.His response was curious: He dismissed the accuracy of the portal. Even said he had no idea how it worked and that it's totally separate to their own system, which still says ""mid October"".The only change he's claiming to see on his system is to the ""product code"" compared to July, which he interprets as the advent of cars with CarPlay compatibility built in.I still get a strong sense I'm being strung along. I'm baffled at the idea there are two systems, or that he could have zero knowledge of Toyota's own customer tracking portal. I'm very curious what experience people here have had — how far before manufacture does the ""build month"" field actually get populated?",2019-Sep-17,whrl.pl/RfVTPl

Have a detailer that quoted me 795 plus 495 for the ceramic tint... 1095 if i choose opticoat pro+You can get opticoat or any other plethora of pain protection products added by a authorised detailer for <$600. And to be honest, the only difference is your car will look like it's been waxed recently. It doesn't do much for protection. Modern vehicles already have multiple layers of clear coat as it is. If you're the kind of person to wash your car frequently and wax it/use sealant then there's better places to spend your money.Despite what they claim it won't protect against scratches or marks.For something that will actually protect against damage you could get a clear bra put on for the same price.Same goes for tinting, in my personal experience dealer installed tint has always been shoddy as far as fit and finish and overpriced by at least $100 as well as being restricted by their product of the month. Go to a private detailer/tint installer and pick a film and opacity that's better suited than a mix match of opacity around the car.",2019-Sep-19,whrl.pl/RfVX6J

For something that will actually protect against damage you could get a clear bra put on for the same price....

Similar to a phone screen protector.Here's a comparison https://youtu.be/5mhmg4DPhBoA clear bra typically ranges from $400-$1100 depending on how much coverage you want.

My thoughts too. Not that I want to spend that much but I’d prefer the cruiser with this feature rather than the edge without it. It’s practical for me and my other half.

I was really happy with that.I am hoping to change my own oil and oil filter at 1600km – can I obtain oil filter and oil from my dealership spare parts department without them looking at me in a sus way and asking too many questions? Anyone had any experiences? Will I get questions on why am I attempting to service my own car etc?,2019-Oct-8,whrl.pl/RfWBTH

Now while I and many others would be able to do an oil and filter change I'm not sure that putting myself in a position of ""warranty refusal"" if something went wrong is worth the hassle because of not having the qualificationsEspecially in your case where you want to do it at 1600 klms when the manufacturer is I would guess 12 months or ? klmsI have decided to follow the manufacturers guidelines for service (no matter what manufacturer) at least during the warranty period",2019-Oct-8,whrl.pl/RfWB80

"For those who purchased the Cruiser Hybrid AWD have you asked for an estimated delivery date in the contract?Toyota are all over the shop. I ordered my 2WD Cruiser Hybrid in late July. Up until I literally signed, the dealer (Sydney based), verbally was ""three months"". Suddenly, the hastily written ETA on the contract I was presented with said Christmas.Later, I asked for an electronic copy of the sale contract, and the ETA had been adjusted to 31st October, with a mid-Oct build. Progress!, or so I thought.After hearing here and elsewhere about extensive Hybrid delays, it took pushing from me to get the dealer to grudgingly admit it was now ""mid November build, delivery December"".No sooner had he written that, he added “Toyota are unable to supply any Toyota dealers ETA’s on these vehicles”, which makes me wonder what basis he has for his revised ETA. Sounds like BS to me.The icing on the cake is that 11 weeks after ordering, there is still zero information on the  Toyota Customer Order Tracking Portal. I mean, that website has one job...As I've said before, Toyota are doing a horrible job of keeping their dealers and customers informed.I can't be cranky about the delay on a new and popular vehicle.I am now very cranky about being given inaccurate information about the delay.You'd think that three months after ordering a car, Toyota could give you an accurate idea of when your car will be built.This does not bode well.

"I don't think it is peculiar to Japanese cars as I have the same problem in my Mercedes. I think that it may have more to do with the pump than the tankThere isn’t any issues with the tank for the hybrids in Australia.What I was trying to say is that the throat design of the car limits the flow into the tank causing some backing up of flow during the fill causing the autoshutoff sensor in the nozzle to switch off with clicks.Again the the throat design may be similar in European cars too. While so, they seem to be ok. Something in the design for cars in the US may be restricting flow in the throat. Either this or maybe the nozzles are different in the US and may not be as compatible as ours when fitting into the fuel filler throat.",2019-Oct-21,whrl.pl/RfW1Le

The warning tags on the number plates are a very good idea as the voltages from a battery pack are well over 45v which is about the voltage that kills you.

It's a PR train-wreck.- Says that cars ordered in the same time frame as mine can just randomly ""turn up"" unexpectedly, but rarely.- Cruiser Hybrids are the worst for waiting. GX / GXL Hybrids only slightly better. Petrol versions much shorter waits.- Dealer had no knowledge of the piloted rental scheme linked earlier in this thread for customers enduring a long wait. Showed him the CarsGuide story. First time he'd seen it.- Says people with genuine orders already in the system will be ""protected"" from the RAV4 price rise, which will be about $650. I was emphatic, saying I would hold him to that.- His best guess for my car, with a shrug, was ""next year"". Sheesh.",2019-Nov-1,whrl.pl/RfXnLg

Turn car off, get out of the car, lock it, and then they auto-fold in, this is the way it should be.

Also, the mirror folding rocker switch in the armrest should be 3-position for folded/auto/unfolded operation, whereas in my Cruiser, that rocker switch only has 2 positions (folded/unfolded).So, it looks like we don't have the Autofolding option.

"Hi all, Got ACP/AA installed today (Cruiser Hybrid 2WD). Here are the key points that people were asking about:1) I have not noticed any visual changes in the screen bezel or in the light/roof button operating console at the top.I did take the pictures of those areas BEFORE and AFTER the installation, and they look 100% identical. I can upload those pictures if someone gives me a good reason why you need them.2) The ACP/AA operation is supported ONLY via USB cable connection. Wireless operation is NOT supported.3) Experience with Android Auto: I use Android phone with OS version 9 (Pie). To operate Android Auto (further: AA) you have to install the AA application on your phone. Also, it requires Google Play, Google Maps and one other app (I forgot) that should be already installed on your phone. Once I got it configured and connected, I was very unimpressed of how few things it can actually do.  This video is fairly representative of what you get: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDdIe8zEEWMThe screen looks like the one on 3:50 in that video, except I only have: Maps, Play Music, Podcasts and Phone.  That's all !Where is Messenger? Where is a Calendar? Calculator? Where is Youtube? Where are all other applications that I can run on my phone?They called it ""screen mirroring software"" ???  That's utterly misleading, as it is absolutely nothing like screen mirroring... I expected that I would be able to do on the car screen everything that I can do on my phone's screen, but this is definitely not the case.

I had the choice of accepting the 18"" wheels (with $1500 visa card), wait until Jan for a new car or cancel my order altogether.  I can't wait until Jan and I really don't like the 18"" wheels so I was in a dilemma.  My dealer suggested using part of my $1500 towards having the rims painted black (so it would look like the hybrid model).  As I just can't wait any longer, I decided to go with the rims being painted black but told them I wasn't paying for it as it is Toyota's error and they agreed.  I'm hoping it's a good decision as I really like the look of the all black wheels and the whole car is white/black anyway, but I wasn't left with a lot of great options so unfortunately not overly impressed with the situation.I paid $42400 for the above car, including crystal pearl colour, window tinting, carpet floor mats, rubber cargo mat and roof racks and now have $1500 coming back to me – hopefully it's a happy accident!",2019-Nov-16,whrl.pl/RfXTPB

Yes you do hold the fob near the start button for a couple of seconds that’s what my dealer told me anyway.

Have been told it will take up to a week to get a replacement window which then needs to be tinted. Lucky the car is insured but just so mad about morons who do things like this.

"Hey all – for the cameras, I believe you can turn the sound recording off (I'd have to verify that via book though). My regret with the Toyota brand one is that it only records the front of car, would have loved something more 360° or at least front/back.... Although at least the Toyota brand one fits the car decor well.I did get the Android Auto install done yesterday; took 2 hours, while the reception were really great with me I was quite dissapointed to not be given an instruction manual of any kind like the PDF shared previously; nor did a rep sit with me to show me what to do and ensure it was working with my phone.Admittedly I was grumpy after a long day and a longish wait, only to find it wasn't connecting for me. The culprit in this case was the cable I used – was a 1m cable used for Samsung fastcharge, for some reason it'd stay connected for 10 seconds then drop.Got home, shorter cable worked great; I highly recommend having Google Maps running with both Traffic and Satellite imagery (although after 20 mins of driving I lost the satellite imaging for some reason, possibly either a bug or poor mobile reception)Other than that, I'm rather annoyed that my Samsung Galaxy S10+ is meant to be compatible for 'Wireless' Android Auto, but so far I've not been able to get it working – tried connecting via Wifi but that wasn't the magic bullet for me.... Will have to investigate further. As others have said, having a wired setup makes the wireless charging redundant (and is just a PITA having to plug it in each time).Edit: I've found this gem of a tutorial – have enrolled as a Beta tester and enabled dev mode in Android Auto: will keep everyone posted tomorrow how it goes https://www.xda-developers.com/wireless-android-auto-any-android-phone/",2019-Nov-19,whrl.pl/RfXZlQ

I think it stood when closing if something is in the way , but was wondering when opening.I am going to set it to not open all the way as my garage roof is low.1) As you mentioned, you can limit the opening angle from the console menu or by the buttons on the rear door – please see the owners manual. One inconvenience here is when you are getting something from the boot and pulling out, you forget that the door is opened lower – I already bumped the back of my head twice. Ouch. Hard way to remember. :-)))2) If you are watching the door while it's opening, you can stop it in any mid position by short pressing of the button on the door itself or on the remote. But I would not rely on this as it's just a matter of time before you either forget to look at it while opening, or accidentally press the opening button on the remote control.3) As for the sensor – no, it does not have a dedicated proximity sensor, but it senses the resisting effort and stops opening if it's too high – you can test this by trying to stop the door with your hand when it's half way open and still moving. Note though that by the time the garage ceiling stops the door, it still can get the scratches and/or dents, depending on how hard/rough the stopping surface is. So, I have limited the max opening for my car already (mind your head! :).",2019-Nov-19,whrl.pl/RfXZGJ

It's the dashboard top glare bounced off the internal surface of the windscreen back to the dashcam.Think of the torch instead of the dashcam mounted the same way and shooting the beam onto the road through the windscreen. Some of that light will be reflecting down from the windscreen and falling onto the dashboard top.With Dashcam it is exactly the same light path, but in reverse direction of light travel.People use the black matte mats (excuse the pun) on the top of the dashboard (yuk!) and/or polarizing filters  – both solutions have only limited effect.",2019-Nov-19,whrl.pl/RfX0eq

The wire from the cam goes up then to the left, held by the folded up passenger's sun shieldthen drops down along the left arch (I tucked it away to under the airbag cover)then jumps into the shelf in front of the passenger seat (where normally a glove box is)then drops down to the wireless charger area to the USB output there.

Also see the link in my post on this page to the list of applications compatible with AA. Then it's up to you to decide if you will benefit from getting AA and apps installed.

Hybrid vs non hybrid?,2019-Nov-30,whrl.pl/RfYlme
"The general view seems to be strongly in favour of the hybrid, but the waiting time of 6-12 months or even more, might dissuade you. I just visited Nunawading Toyota, which had about eight or ten new RAV4s on the lot, none Hybrids. That delay might get worse with the recent decision by Drive and others to award it Car of the Year for 2020.From commentary in Australia and US forums there seems to be some unease about transmission issues on AWD non-hybrids, with minor grumbles of noises etc. I am not sure whether the gripes are reasonable or legitimate, but the AWD hybrid has no mechanical connection between front and rear axles, relying on a separate electric motor on the rear axle. I have seen no adverse remarks on this arrangement.Whilst the RAV4 is a very competent SUV, it would probably not have outclassed the Subaru Forester (or a couple of others) in my assessment, but for the availability of a good hybrid drive-train. That is probably that major thing that really what sets it apart from other SUVs at present.",2019-Dec-1,whrl.pl/RfYneF

"digital_silence writes...Does this mean the battery never gets fully charged? How else do you tell the state of charge, apart from that icon?If you have a scanguage, it will show you that all hybrid batteries (Li-ion & NiMH) float between 40% to 80%. 60% being the resting position. Once the car runs up to 70%, the charge the hybrid system pushes into the battery drops on its way to 80%. This also dependent on the temp of the batteries also. TBH, I've only seen 80% a few times in my years of owning a hybrid and it occurs for example down the M6 heading into Wollongong or going down into Jenolan caves where the elevation drop is very very long and/or speeds are higher.To the regular consumer, the display showing fully charged is around 73-75%. Minimum is 40% and that's when the engine will kick in to charge it back to 50%. If you're in heavy traffic and the A/C is drawing a lot of power (again, this will vary depending on whether you've just turned it on in the past 5 mins), you will see it dip below 40%. I've personally seen close to 30% and anything below 37% is where I start to worry and park on the side of the road with A/C off to at least allow the system to get back up to 50%.",2019-Dec-4,whrl.pl/RfYt2a

"Interesting chat with a fleet sales guy today. He says that many customers, unable to secure a Hybrid within reasonable time-frames, are shifting their orders to the Edge model. Fleet buyers are usually under time pressure and cannot wait too long for delivery. He commented that I was unusual for a fleet customer, as I could comfortably wait the six months for delivery. I guess that means that hybrids are not making their way into fleets to the penetration that one might expect, but conversely, private buyers can often afford to wait and hence the sales numbers for hybrids are likely to be distorted towards private buyers",2019-Dec-7,whrl.pl/RfYAJ4

The program is a 'Guaranteed Buy Back' after the 4 years are up.

Please show me.My math on the previous page is correct, but I found the error in my given conditions: On my old car (V6), I used to fuel up every week on average (doing >500Km a week), and that's the pattern I used in my calcs.

"There are more benefits than just fewer fuel consumptions in riding a hybrid car, especially if you are commuting around city or high traffic areas.1- My favourite reason is no idling car anymore!  No matter waiting for someone or in traffic, enjoy your electric power when cannot move,  or for any reason, you need your vehicle to be on but with no movement, and no waste of fuel! Fantastic! Isn't it?2- Great instant torque that you have to try! That's because how hybrid engine is working and that is what I call hybrid characteristic.3- One more important reason! It has a lower emission! Which means helping your environment cleaner, also at least in victoria there is a $100 DISCOUNT for your rego of hybrid cars! More save, now its $700 saved per year that you can spend on sth else! One more reason! Wasting less time in refilling your tank! Personally, I am lazy to refill the petrol, and I like to postpone this always! But it probably not my only motivation!4- Not only saving but also enjoying the traffic! Or any carpool situation! not worried about fuel waste or engine damage! Activate all radars and active cruise control and do not worry about anything than a piece of music or a pleasant conversation if you are with another passenger! So again, save $100, having a cleaner environment and enjoy the traffic! In the USA, in highways, hybrid car drivers, even though they are driving alone, they are still allowed to drive in HOV lane in jam time!5- Practice for the future as the future would be electric cars, and that helps you justify your driving habits and skills when you are driving a hybrid car, plus all hybrid cars in the world are usually high-performance cars.6- Like others said high resale value in Hybrid cars is common since usually Hybrid vehicles are equipped well too.So yes, it is saving, yes, you may not buy a car to save money! But hey! Why not when you can! But more valuable than money to me is fewer emissions and cleaner tailpipes! And not worried about the idle times!

"1vic@ writes...Where I disagree or am somwhat confused.. the Prime provides everything the non Prime version does, but with the added feature of plug in, or more importantly drive on battery for 60km, which is more than enough for day to day driving??Not sure if I understand your question, but to me, the linked article, and the Toyota’s VP S&M quotes from it, make very little sense, if at all. That guy, Sean Hanley, said:It's not that we can't bring plug-in hybrids to market. We can, at some point. It's whether or not the market will accept it, Right now, Australian consumers are clearly, in my opinion, voting for hybrid electric. I don't know why anyone else isn't seeing that. It's certainly what we're seeing.We are seeing that, Sean. We are in fact the ones who voted. However, how can you compare the demand for what's available with the demand for what's NOT available??? To give the consumers the chance of their GENUINE voting (by their money), all candidates should be available for purchase.  At least, for preorder. Of course, consumers vote for hybrids, because they can't (physically and technically) do for plug-in hybrid. Come on Toyota! Stop making handwavy statements, bring the plug in hybrid here and compare the demand! You don't even have to bring the physical cars – just open the preorders. From what I can see reading this thread, I'd say about 70%+ of RAV4 Hybrid owners (me included) or buyers would switch to, or rather go for in a first place, plug in hybrid, if we could. (subject to the price, I guess) How's that for the demand comparison, Sean?",2019-Dec-15,whrl.pl/RfYNiY
"Who's going to train the dealerships when repairs are required? What about smash repairers on how to handle the much bigger battery system? What about the homologation to tick the ADR boxes?Whilst I appreciate as much as anyone else to just bring the thing in as now a consumer, for a business, there are more considerations that needs to happen similar to way back in 2001 when the business decided to bring the first Prius to the tiny Australian market.Then there's Japan to even allow it to be imported. Sean can only lobby for it. ADR is still a barrier plus the fact Australia is still a ""hot"" climate even if ADR was abolished with bigger radiator cores/trans cooler if they determine it to be required and available on the production line.",2019-Dec-15,whrl.pl/RfYNpx
"I could go to every point in details, Tofu, but that would distract us from the big picture.You brought up the valid points, but they are all related to TOYOTA’S SIDE considerations of business viability of bringing the plug in hybrid (PIH) to Au. Sean Hanley, however, has attributed the reasons for not bringing the PIH here, to CONSUMERS SIDE, not to Toyota.In short, he said:""We can bring it in, but you guys don't want it"" which is quite different from saying:""You guys may or may not want it, so it's too bothersome for us to bring it"".The truth is the latter, but he said the former.Sales & Marketing at its best.",2019-Dec-15,whrl.pl/RfYNqE

Manufacturers no longer have a monopoly on what we can and can't have coz if they won't do it, SEVS will fix it.Btw, there's a lot of ""I think"" thinking there. Carplay and AA as an example.

"Where does Toyota advertise 3 years of free map updates on ALL models? To my knowledge it only applies to Camrys.However, if asked, the dealers will certainly apply the current map 'update' at no cost where a new vehicle is supplied with out of date maps. My Aug 19 build Rav4 came with April 18 maps, and the update applied in Dec 19 was to April 19 maps. To my knowledge, Toyota only updates maps once each year, around April.Personally, I like the integration of the Toyota navigation with other vehicle functions. I had the free android / apple carplay install performed, and tried it out with Android, then switched it off as I prefer the 'native' Toyota nav / audio / bluetooth phone functionality. Updates erase personal data and non-default options, so be ready to re-apply these.By the way, I found zero wait time in Oct 19 for a white AWD hybrid GX. 3500km on, my fuel consumption calculated at refills is consistently below 5l/100km in city or highway, unless I use roof racks.

"Prices in a table like https://bit.ly/2X56mkN are meaningless without details of trade in and accessories. A major factor in any discount below rrp is the balance between supply and demand (not presently in a potential rav4 hybrid buyer's favour). Other factors like the dealer's proximity to monthly or annual sales quotas or bonus levels are generally not advertised. So you just have to look up the rrp for your preferred model, work out a fair retail price for your trade, phone about availability of the model you want, then go in and negotiate. It will go like this: Let's say your trade in is worth $10,000 by private sale. The dealer will start with an insulting offer of $2,500 and tell you that they have to cover marketing costs, warranty, etc. etc. After a good deal of haggling,  when you are about to leave to check other dealers or sell your old car privately before making any purchase, they will come up to $5,000 trade. But the contract will show $3,000 trade and $2,000 ""allowance"" (discount) off the rrp. The actual amounts depend on factors like those mentioned above.

"The issue is apparently unknown outside the USA. I have read many of the US posts that seem to be misunderstanding the point at which the RAV4 shows ""Empty"". The total fuel tank size is about 55 litres and the ""Empty warning still has been about 5-15 litres remaining. This is consistent with my experience in a Kluger which shows ""Empty"" with 16 litres remaining in the tank. Running a fuel tank totally dry is not a great idea as there is an accumulation of crud at the bottom of the tank and the submerged fuel pump relies on immersion in fuel for lubrication and cooling If i interpret the distance traveled and distance to empty read-outs correctly, they seem to suggest the full calculated fuel load is about 45 litres (approximately 10 Imperial Gallons, implying about 10 litres remains in my tank or a bit over 2 Imperial Gallons.All of the posts I have seen sound as if they are seeking to fill up the air space and carbon canister that sits at the top of the tank.",2019-Dec-25,whrl.pl/RfY6lp

"Had the chance to quickly take a friend's hybrid for a spin around my suburb today (not 100% sure if it was the 2019 or 2020, I forgot to ask) and I loved every minute of it.Favourite thing by far is 'EV Mode'. I've never driven a Hybrid or EV or anything like that because I frankly can't afford one yet, so turning on the car, reversing out of the carpark and driving off without any engine noise whatsoever was no doubt the weirdest but most amazing first experience I've ever had with a car. It eventually fired up the engine once I got out onto the main road and had to put my foot down a bit to merge, but I was honestly surprised how quickly it seemed to drop down to EV mode when decelerating coming to a red light or just low speed traffic. Didn't have a chance to test out the fuel economy for myself but it's apparently REALLY good.The only thing I found a bit weird was the visibility from the driver's seat. Most of the other SUVs I've test driven (Mazda CX5, Hyundai Santa Fe, et) and even my current 10 year old corolla have much more 'window' to see through at the front. Maybe it's just something I need to get used to.I was originally thinking of making the jump straight to an EV in 1-3 years when I'll be in a position to upgrade from the car I drive now, but the Rav4 hybrid definitely has my attention now.",2020-Jan-18,whrl.pl/RfZOXl

"Whoever told you 3 months has deliberately misled you and was not following Toyota's official notice – which is that the RAV4 Hybrid is a 7-9 month wait...Except that isn't what Toyota has said at all.When responding to reports of delays caused by a sales-stop back in July, Toyota refused to tell CarSales.com.au about delays at all:However, it won’t say what kind of delays customers should expect for delivery of 2169 Camry, Corolla, Prius and RAV4 hybrid vehicles produced between April and May this year, the majority of which were checked and released after being ""found to be consistent with Toyota’s manufacturing standards"".Then, in October, CarsGuide.com.au finally got an admission delays were much worse:The wait time for the top-spec Cruiser hybrid RAV4 – which won our mid-sized AWD SUV comparison earlier in 2019 – is now at ""about six months"".By early December, CarAdvice.com.au  reported:However, a statement from Toyota Australia issued to CarAdvice this week said: “The supply outlook for hybrid is good, and in most cases is what we would define as a reasonable wait time of three to four months”.The one exception is the delay on Toyota RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid “which could be up to six months”.However, Toyota added “the supply outlook for the first few months of next year is very strong, so these waiting times are likely to reduce. (The RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid) may have a six-month wait for now, but that could come back to three or four months as supply improves early next year”.Ironically, in the same week in December, whichcar.com.au were being told:Such is the demand for the RAV4 Cruiser hybrid that, at its peak, customers were told that they wouldn’t receive their vehicles for eight months after signing on the dotted line.Speaking with Wheels, Toyota Australia Vice President Sales and Marketing, Sean Hanley, said that waiting times are reducing and that everything is being done to aid supply as quickly as possible.“It was at a peak of around eight months, and by the end of the year that’ll drop down to six months.The upshot being is that people who bought in June and July (like me) were most definitely told the wait would be 3-4 months. Toyota denied for months the delays would be worse, and it took until October for them to change to ""6 months tops"" in public statements, even though their Vice President immediately contradicted it by admitted to up to 8 months.Personally, I'm convinced that if they've lied consistently, then they're lying now as well.

"I see there is a lot of discussion about delivery times. I will try to explain a very complex process as simply as I can.Dealer supply works on an allocation system based on TMCA’s forward order. That annual order is done 12 months in advance. The annual volume rarely changes; all that can be done is adjust when it is manufactured.  ie delayed or brought forward. The mix of model, grade & factory options are firmed up about 3 months before production, colour and trim is confirmed at time of production order. TMCA only orders once a month for delivery in 2 month’s time. A dealer’s fair share of the allocation is earned by a complex formula. Some small country dealer may only earn one every 2 months whereas a major metro dealer may earn 30 a month. The number of retail orders a dealer has, has little impact on the volume supply to a dealer but may affect the mix. That is why it is hard for a dealer to predict when they will get a vehicle in the specification you want. Hybrid sales historically have been in the range of 20-40%  of a model line. And therefore I suggest that TMCA when they did their production plan for 2019 (in the middle of 2018) they ordered 40% RAV4 as hybrid. History now says the demand is in the 60-75% range. That is why the delivery time is so hard to predict. Soon 2020 production will start to flow and I suggest that TMCA have upped the 2020 annual order mix of hybrid’s to match the demand. This is assuming TMC has the capacity to build more. For lots of reasons the vehicle tracking system is only of benefit once a dealer has a confirmed production vehicle allocated to them and a retail order from you that matches the specification exactly. (Vehicle tracking wasn’t designed to work in WA). At the end of the day they are a great vehicle and worth the wait.",2020-Jan-31,whrl.pl/Rf0dZ0

Awesome. Thank you Graham121 and Cloudripper.Out of curiosity.

"Somethingnew writes...as per RAV4's manual, the camera recognises the speed sign, when you are cruising along say at 100km/h, and there is sign of 60km/h as road works ahead, RAV4 will beep or indicate it has detected 60 sign, and if the driver wants to change the speed to 60, then on cruise control buttons he presses ""-"" button to decrease to 60... only after driver presses the button... and same goes the other way, form 60 to 100 (when 100 recognised by RAV4) one has to press ""+"" key to tell car to speed up to 100.so the driver is in control to make the call, the car does not makes it for you.Question: Do you drive RAV4 2019?If you did, you would know that regardless of what speed limit sign is recognized, while in cruise control, short press of ""-"" button reduces the speed setpoint by 1km/h, and long press reduces it by 5km/h, and will keep reducing it in increments of 5km/h as long as the button is pressed, not stopping at the recognised speed limit. same goes to ""+"" button in the opposite direction.I tried this many times on my Cruiser.

I spoke to Toyota Au about this, as I see it to be a safety issue (search my posts in this thread by the word ""mirrors"" if you want to see why), and Toyota said that if they had enough feedback from the customers, they would consider adding this into the future firmware upgrades.So, please consider lodging you formal complaint with Toyota re those mirrors – they have a web form on their site to do that.I also looked at the aftermarket kits to add this feature, but we have to be careful as doing that might affect the warranty.",2020-Feb-7,whrl.pl/Rf0tp4

Ours had had a price increase since purchase to build but weren’t asked to pay the extra. The one reason I liked the cruiser is the electric drivers seat would go to a position which suited me regarding my height and size. A few other contenders were not as comfortable.

"Current wait time 6 monthshttps://www.caradvice.com.au/826738/toyota-rav4-hybrid-waiting-time/The waiting time for a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid has been quoted from three months to more than a year. Here's the latest response from Toyota on this moving target.36 SHARESThe longest waiting time for customers to get their hands on a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Cruiser was up to eight months, Toyota Australia has confirmed to CarAdvice, after the company recently claimed the delay had been cut to three months.The popularity of the range-topping RAV4 Hybrid caught Toyota Australia off guard. The brand expected the Hybrid would equate to 20 per cent of RAV4 sales but, in June last year, it revealed demand was closer to 60 per cent.As a result, a month after the new RAV4 went on sale, a waiting period of up to four months was confirmed.However Toyota vice president of sales and marketing, Sean Hanley, last week told CarAdvice’s Automotive Industry Insights Podcast the wait is now longer.“The truth is, the highest it got to was around eight months, and that was late last year,” Hanley said.We think by the end of this month (February), we will be able to get that down to around six months, and then by the second half, we think we might bring that down even further; maybe four months.”There have been varying reports, with some customers being told they face a 12-month wait by dealerships, but Hanley denied it.“This whole idea that there’s this 12-month wait … right now, there’s not. It’s around six months as we sit here today.”Hanley admitted Toyota Australia could’ve handled the communication better, by keeping customers and dealerships up-to-date with the waiting period.“What we got to do – and we understand we’ve got to do a better job of – is communicate to our customers those dates. But we’ve also got to open up the window of that communication to our dealer network, so we’ve recognised that.""We’ve looked at this over the last two weeks because it’s deeply important we get this right. We’ve now put a process in place that will enable our dealers to give more accurate information to the customer. We’ve been communicating with our customers in various ways to reassure them the car is coming,"" Hanley concluded.Last month’s new car sales figures saw the RAV4 come out on top in the under $60,000 medium SUV segment with a 19 per cent share – a common occurrence since the all-new RAV4 was launched in the second quarter of 2019.",2020-Feb-15,whrl.pl/Rf0JFF

"Strength Through Unity writes...the price premium doesn’t really justify it.I did some back of the envelope calculations and it really depends on how long you intend to keep it.The price difference between a 2WD hybrid and 2WD petrol for the Cruiser is approx $2k. Assume cost of petrol is $1.21/L. Given the fuel mileage difference is 1.8L/100km, this means it is $2.20 (1.21*1.8) more expensive for every 100km driven or $0.022 per km driven. Given the price difference, it’ll take you about 91000 kms ($2k/0.022) to break even or about 6 years of driving an average of 15k km per year. If the fuel price is more expensive then the break even time is lower.This doesn’t take into account the cost of the battery checks after 5 years if you want the hybrid battery warranty to be extended to 10 years (not sure if this costs extra but I assume so). Also the AWD only comes in hybrid and has much more towing power so that’s a consideration as well.Lastly hybrid is the most common variant so if you decide to sell in the future, it will yield a bigger market to which you’ll probably recoup the extra you spent.",2020-Feb-15,whrl.pl/Rf0JL9

You would save $936 per year with hybrid. Say battery last 7years, that’s $6552 savings.$60 a week will buy you say 40 litres of U95. Meaning that you are making 800km (5L/100km = 40L/800km) a week.

It's more like 20000 km per year, so your savings figures should be halved.(I know, I fell into the same mind trap many pages back – you now fuel up every week for $60, because you are probably driving V6 which consumes 10+ L/100km, and that's the pattern you are using.

A lot can change in 18 months including new vehicles from other makers that may alter a buyers choice and of course pricing if more hybrid options become available.I know the delays are not a marketing strategy by Toyota but some other cars such as the new cx-30 (which has no market killing feature and not hybrid) are also supposedly in short supply. Makes my cynical mind think that perhaps this may gain footing with limited supply reducing price bargaining and the fear of missing out or facing long waits adding pressure to buyers to act now.

There's always a lot of excess built into these charges.The delivery fee does not include the delivery of the vehicle to the dealer, it is the delar's charge to deliver it to you. It includes washing the car, peeling off the plastic, filling up the tank and screwing on the number plates. That's all. The real value of this is $200 at best, however it's another way the dealers make the money.You never negotiate the delivery fee, you negotiate the net price of the vehicle, so if you want a grand or two off the price of the car, then you offer $41k instead of $43k or whatever, but not negotiating the delivery fee. It's up to the dealer how to make this price reality. If they can't – you walk away and play it smart. They'll call you back.Negotiating the price of the vhicle is a specific art and you need to know quite a few things; the deler stock, if they have met or are close to meet their sales target, be there on specific date and have your finances completely sorted out. You also need to negotiate price of the vehicle before any discussion about finance takes place.

"It's really hard to tell, it depends on asking price, on the demand for the vehicle, stock levels, date in the months, etc.There are three 'first' things you need to do first:1st – find a vehicle at a delership that offers you what you would be willing to pay if everything else fails, so that is your walk-back strategy, and leave this one alone for now.1st – sort your source of funds.Do not let the dealer source your finance, they will take you for a ride, they get kickbacks left, right and centre, and you are the one who pays this (loan establishment fee $800-2000 for 10 min of work, dealer commission $500-$2000, also 10 min work and of course interest rate that they will tell you that they can do nothing about it. Oh, also the monthly account keeping fee (5 year loan = 60 x $5-$10 = $300-$600) Credit unions will generally give you 5-6% with no monthly fees and $100-200 establishment fee.1st  – go to the dealer on 28th of the month or later. This is when they are desperate to meet their sales targets. One car can bring them over the line and scoop 10s of thousands of money, so they will be awilling to do anyithgn you want.2nd – you do not trade in, this is a purest possible loss of $2-5k, maybe even more. Sell privately. Always.Now you start negotiating.You lowball, say for a  listed $45k car, you sart with ""I have another delaer who is willing to sell me the same car for $39,5k, but it's not my favourite colur"" When they ask who is it just respond with ""nice try, hehe"".See what they can come up with, say you're happy to pay that price if you offer me the right colour.They will counter offer something in between and you need to be firm there. They will ask you what accessories you need, how do you finance, do you have a trade in ... all these are designed to get more money out of you.Do NOT show any emotions, and don't take your partne or kids under any circumstances. A single ""but I love this car"" will cost you $1000.They will go to 'ask the boss' which is bullshit, they just give you time to simmer on your doubts and to cave in to their demands.The more they go back and forth, the more desperate they are to meet the sales target, so that's a good news. If they flatly refuse and say we can give you the car for x amount and don't budge, you either buy it, go back to your walk-back dealer or wait another month.Once they start offering you accessories, be aware that it's anotehr con. They will say we'll include floormats and window tint for nothing. They will say that this is a saving og $110 for mats and $400 for tint, but for them it's really $30 for mats and $250 for tint.Then you can say, OK, finen I'll take the car for $40k with these inclusions and close the deal.Of course, the $39.5k wrong colour deal with another deler is just a bluff, never happened.If they don't get to where you want it, be ready to walk away. THe car will never ever go up in price, it will only get cheaper next months, quarter, year. Be patient.I know this sounds hard and complicated, but that's how it is. It's an open market, they have goods, you have the money. The question is at what point you meet each other's demand and exchange your valuables.It's as simple as that. Same as buying something at garage sale, they want 50 bucks for a chair, you offer $30 and you meet somewhere ... or not.I have bought and sold many cars in my life and I'm not a dealer, never worked for or with one and have no association with any of them.",2020-Feb-23,whrl.pl/Rf01yA

Also, make sure that you’ve done your homework and know the value of what you’re buying and the value of your trade (if you have one). I’m always prepared to walk away if I’m not happy and have done so on many occasions.I’m very happy with my deal and the 3-4 week delivery on a Cruiser Hybrid AWD with my preferred choice of colour.I found my local dealer to be very obliging and he was very keen to sell even with the high demand for these vehicles.This is my first entry into a hybrid after 4 turbo diesels in the last seven years. I love the torque and economy of the diesel cars but the European emissions requirements have pretty much put an end to their era and I suspect resale values will also be affected in coming years. My test drive of the  RAV4 4 Hybrid was better than I expected. Whilst probably not performing as well as my previous turbo diesels, it did far exceed my performance expectations  and is certainly more than enough.

"I am a new joinee to the RAV4 waiting line. Booked the Hybrid Cruiser AWD in Atomic Rush on Australia Day for 46.2k in Sydney.Price – there is no point discussing the prices based on my experience – there are just two prices out there for the whole of the Hybrid RAV range. One for the retail and one for the fleet. The one for the retail is a tad flexible – maybe upto a 1000 max, but no dealer is budging really. I got the fleet price. And it comes with a tank full of E10 (which I have clearly instructed the dealer not to, but I know they still will), floor mats and a few other standard bits and pieces.Wait Time – Told that there is a wait time of 6 to 8 months. What surprises me is the variances in the wait times – Toyota Exec was stating it is now 6 months, dealer says that nothing much has changed really. It is all confusing and not the best of the experience in real sense. Yes, Toyota has been caught off guard about 6 months back. but 6 months is a very long time in real sense to fix their supply chain issues and it is clearly not an industry first. I can understand that production happen in batches of similar models and trims and so a Hybrid Cruiser AWD with black interiors may differ in delivery times to the one with nutmeg interiors. Or that a GXL and Cruiser may have different waiting queues, but then, this seems to be utter chaos.Apple faced a similar situation during the iPhone 3, 4 and 5 era, but then they dealt with it and with each launch, managed their supply chain better. Toyota on the other hand doesn't really seem to care. I am worried that the very car that got them the adulation and monies will end up being a noose around their neck if they don't seem to get a control of the situation.",2020-Feb-26,whrl.pl/Rf06m1

"Brian McGee writes...The question then boils down to whether the hardware for this functionality already exists. If this is the case, then perhaps it's as simple as a firmware upgrade.If you can operate the mirrors manually – you can operate them remotely/automatically. The only difference in hardware is a switch (3-position in UK vs 2-position in AU), and maybe associated wire for the 3rd position. Also (I am guessing here), the power to the mirrors stepper motors may be taken from Vacc, rather than from Vbat.However, the fact that kits like these (see below) exists suggests a piece of hardware componentry is missing. Which means it'll be impossible for it to be implemented via a simple software upgrade.This kit is dodgy, as in the different listing, the seller sells exactly the same item for pre-2018 RAV4.I'm guessing Toyota Australia stripped out some key features like this and the digital RVM in the UK/US variants to remain cost competitive.To me, the cost of stripping this feature off looks higher than if they would keep it – yet another inventory part (switch and cover) to maintain, BOM variants management etc. And what have they saved?

"Milano Red writes...The manual says 0W16 but 5W30 is also acceptable, which ones do the dealership use?Indeed the manual says 0w16.

Which is the reason why it has a viscosity rating of 0 when cold. It basically means, the flow is higher in cold weather. Ensure that you also look at the operating temparature below the table as the X-axis.For Australian conditions and what I do on my current Camry is go for 5w30 during winter and 10w40 in Summer. If I was in Canberra, would have done 0w40 throughout because of the cooler weather compared to Sydney. By the way, always go for Full Synthetic. Nothing else, especially with these modern cars.Now, the dealers get their oil in bulk and would typically go for 0w30 or 0w40. The so called genuine Toyota Motor Oil is Castrol Magnatec non-synthetic for most part. The reason why they go for 0w30 or 0w40 is because it works for most or all cars they will service.

The current illumination levels are insanely strong for me at night.",2020-Mar-2,whrl.pl/Rf1hMO

"I've just did a test drive of Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. I've just sold my Tiguan Highline and naturally that's my banchmark. RAV4 is not as premium which I was expected a little but still surprised me because:- It's  full of hard plastic, dashboard, doors, center console etc. I don't want to see this much plastic in a $50k car,- The hard plastic used is flimsy, shake centre console it moves, plastic used on the doors so thin it's springy when pushed,- It's not fun to drive and engine is not as responsive as Tiguan 162TSI, - The centre screen seems from 1990s, small, low resolution and buttons around the screen are primitive.- Sunroof, seats, stitches, mirrors, electronic dashboard, whereever you look at is all lower grade.I really wanted to like it but test drive was a bit of a let down.

"Sharp® writes...I've just did a test drive of Cruiser Hybrid on the weekend. I've just sold my Tiguan Highline and naturally that's my banchmark. RAV4 is not as premiumWe looked at Tiguan AllSpace and RAV4 Cruiser AWD. We've owned/own a range of VW group cars (I drive an Audi).Agree the dynamics on the Tiguan are better than the RAV4 (and certainly having owned various VW group cars the feeling is very familiar). We found though the RAV4 is a much more pleasant car to drive around day-to-day – the electric boost from zero is much handier and the suspension whilst not as ""driver oriented"" is really nice over most of the roads near us. The ""grade of materials"" I guess is what $12k price difference buys you. Given I have kids and this car will be our road trip car I'm less fussy about some of that.Admittedly the big decision point for us is that the RAV4 had a higher roof in the back seats. Me and my son are tall (13 year old who's 6'1"") and both of us didn't fit properly in the Tiguan.Another big thing was running costs. RAV4 is substantially cheaper to run – servicing is a fraction of the VW group cars and less and cheaper fuel (option to do RON91).",2020-Mar-3,whrl.pl/Rf1izt

Not to your liking, tough.Bringing cash to a car dealer is not a benefit at all. Dealers want you to finance through them, so that they can charge you the loan establisment fee ($500-1500), dealer comission ($500 – 1500) and have some kick backs from the interest rate. Ifn most cases there is a mnthly account eeping fee, the king of all cons, that the deler also gets some incentives.Whe you go to buy a car, negotiate the price without any discussion of the payment method. If they ask you how do you want to pay, just say – I'll think about it, but I want to know the price of the vehicle first. If they don't want to negotiate, you walk away (to talk to a competitor) and they'll drag you back with OK, OK, let's talk.",2020-Mar-3,whrl.pl/Rf1iB8

"Been tracking this forum for a while and thought i would share my experience waiting for the Rav4.I'm based in Perth and picked up my AWD Cruiser Hybrid on the 26th of Feb. Ordered in late September 2019 so a total wait time of 5 months. Found the wait very frustrating as the dealer gave me no new information from month to month. Eventually in mid Jan i called and asked to cancel the order and i got given a confirmed delivery for the end of Feb. Not sure if it was coincidental or if they just bumped us up the list at the expense of someone else.I've had the car for a week and in my opinion, it's well worth the wait. Drives and handles very smooth, have absolutely no issues with cabin noise which i was worried about as the 2019 one i test drove was a little thrashy under acceleration. Radar cruise control works great and so does Lane track assist. When on the freeway the car can literally steer itself, not that you should take your hands off the wheel but i found it to be an impressive feature given the price of the car. My only knock would be that you have to plug your phone in to the usb point to get Apple carplay working. I assume this is because it was a bit of an afterthought but it's not that big of an issue. Also like the feature where the car seems to read the speed signs on the side of the road and then displays the speed limit on the screen.After a week of driving in normal mode I'm averaging 5.4L/100km which to me is amazing given the size of the car. I assume this would improve in Eco however, i find the power under acceleration is a little less when in Eco mode so I just leave it in Normal mode.All in all it was a frustrating 5 month wait but I'm very happy with the end result and would highly recommend the hybrid.",2020-Mar-3,whrl.pl/Rf1iZq

I like to put my left foot close to the seat and flip my leg (knee) to the left, but it gives me no space (this is my top con).Storage space. Maybe because I'm coming from X-Trali which is king when it comes to this, but it seems that there is a bit of lack of storage space in the cabin, I'd prefer a 4-5 cm high slot just under or above the air-con controls.All the fuss about the car making various noises and clicks (such as when applying a brake) are not an issue at all. The road noise is audible, but just because the car is so quiet. Engine noise when revving up – not worse than any other CVT car.I picked up mine on Monday and it needs to go back for wheel alignment as it wans't done, or wasn't done properly prior to delivery, the car pulls slightly to the left.The low-beam headlights were also set awfully low to the point that I had to drive with high beam most of the time last night.  I did adjust them myself this arvo and now they are spot-on.No lumbar support adjustment on GXL – sucks.One thing that also sucks, but it sucks on most cars except on their top-end models, is that the seat angle is not adjustable, it's always a bit too much drop at the back, I like the seat being a bit flatter.The horn sounds like it's something from Toys 'r' us, I'll be getting Hella replacements off Amazon soon.The space in the back seat is – amazing. My daughter (18) who is a natural born whinger when it comes to space in the car said ""Wow, you can play cricke here!""Am I the only one that thinks the leather steering wheel doesn't really feel like leather?Infotainment system is average at best.Rear view camera image quality is poor, but ... and there is a big BUT ... the night vision on that camera is phenomenal. The image quality is not good, but the high ISO exposure is top notch. Photographer here, so other photographers will know what I mean when I say it's like Sony A7S (exposure, not quality)Side mirrors are beautiful and in perfect spot. Inside rear view mirror – too close for my liking, but it's the shape of the car that dictates its placement.I put in the dash cam today (Viofo A119), it took me less than 10 minutes. The placement is not ideal, but again – it's the shape of the car.Fuel consumption so far (over 350 km) is 5.2l/100km, driving around Brisbane, mostly 60km/h zone and some small suburban streets. My 2012 Extrail 2.0 turbo diesel did 9.3l doing the same.I could write for the rest of the night, but you get the picture. All in all it's a really, really nice car and I'm very happy with it.",2020-Mar-5,whrl.pl/Rf1oA9

"Nice summary Rommel. Cheers for taking the time.Yes to the door handles , I’ve noticed it in my tight shed.Yes to the centre console. Could be a bit slimmer , not a major for me.

"Nellyxy writes...Did anyone test drive or consider the Honda CRV when looking to buyYes, we did.  I loved the interior of the CRV, and also thought it drove well (we were looking at the V-Ti S).  However – when I did some research online, there were lots of people complaining about the head units failing due to overheating in the sun, and comments about how they were not designed for the Australian climate.  There were a few other quality complaints I found, but I can't remember what they were about now, but the head unit was the one that concerned us the most.  We live in QLD, and so the car will be living in hot conditions (garaged at night obviously but during the day when we're out and about we couldn't guarantee it would be undercover or away from the sun) – so we decided against it.   We also loved all of the features that the RAV4 had as standard.Re the interior of the RAV looking basic – I would agree that it doesn't have quite the 'wow factor' as the interior of the CRV.  However – when you compare it to other mid size SUVs such as the Kia Sportage or Hyundai Tuscon, its miles ahead of those interiors.  For me, the screen placement and the centre console being well laid out and functional were the key must-haves,  along with looking sleek, and the RAV4 meets all of these requirements easily.We've had our RAV4 for about 2 weeks now, and couldn't be happier.

I also have reservations if it will be powerful enough on the highway with 4 people and luggage for a holiday on board. It didn't feel like it had the reserves of power of the RAV on the highway.We've owned a Thai built Honda Jazz for the past five years (our second Honda) and although its never been unreliable, its had its fair share of niggles, so my biased preference is for a Japanese built Japanese car.For the test drive, the displayed fuel consumption was above 9.7l/100km, with a mix of highway and city.

I know the vehicle tracking system very well. Just to be clear. 1. It was never designed to work in WA as they have an   independent distributor. 2. It was only ever designed to work for private sales and small fleet purchases. (Large fleets have access to a different system). 3. It is dependent on the dealer creating a retail order in TMCA's system. (no order no tracking). 4. The dealer at any time can activate / deactivate tracking of a particular order. 5. It is difficult but not impossible to track a vehicle that is being swapped in to fulfill a customers order but this is dependent on both dealers agreeing. 6. A batch is either created when the retail order is created or the order is attached to an existing batch. 7. A dealer can swap an order from one batch to another batch but most dealers just cancel the order and create a new one. This creates issues if they have already given out the order number.  The reasons as to why dealers are not responsive to requests to track a vehicle 1. They don't create a retail order in TMCA's system until they get a batch with confirmed production. 2 They keep adding/deleting the retail order as batch numbers change. 3. The vehicle has been sourced from another dealer and doesn't appear in your dealer's pipe until it has been invoiced to the dealer. 4.Ignorance  on how the system works (or just lazy).,2020-Mar-8,whrl.pl/Rf1vwl
Thanks for the input about the CRV’s. I used to own a Toyota Corona then a Toyota Seca coupe and absolutely loved both so it’s definitely a brand that I have faith in.I was driving a Subaru Forester 2017 until it was in an accident and now I need to replace it. I assumed I’d just get another one but want to keep my options open. The RAV4 did seem quite pricey unless it’s the base model. Would anyone recommend maybe getting a 2-3 year old more premium model? Sorry for all these questions but buying a car is certainly not an easy task! Especially at the 30-34k price point.,2020-Mar-8,whrl.pl/Rf1vwF
"Nellyxy writes...Did anyone test drive or consider the Honda CRV when looking to buy?I really like the look of the RAV4 on the outside but on the inside they seem so basic for a car of that price.I have both.I have RAV4 GXL AWD Hybrid now and my wife has Honda CR-V VTi-S, that I used to drive for quite some time.So here is a quick comparison from my point of view.Looks outside – fom the frot, both cars look amazing, maybe a very slight edge to CRV. From the back RAV4 looks great, Honda looks quite awful, big fat ass momma :-)Looks inside – Honda is somewhat better looking, but not by much. If Toyota worked a bit more on the inforainment system look, it would win it for me. This way is 55:45  in favour of CRV.Talking about the infotainment piece, RAV4 placement is better when you need to look at it while driving, but Honda's easier to reach. RAV4 has buttons that are easier to deal with when driving, Honda relies on touch screen and it can be pain and distractive.Blind spot monitoring – RAV4 has it on both sides and it shows a glowing icon in side mirrors. Honda has it only on passinger side, but it has a camera in the passenger side mirror that turns on as soon as you turn on the left indicator and shows you the live view on the infotainment screen. I LOVE this.RAV4 inside door handle looks nice but it's too far to the front and it's pain in the ass to controll the door swing when in tight space or when windy, Honda's one is perfect.If you like to sit like me, and that's to pull your left foot all the way back close to your seat and flip your knee to the left, Honda is slightly better. CRV central console is a bit narrower and gives you a bit more space there but you'll have a bump under your foot. With RAV4, the console is wider, but the floor is flat under your foot.Honda's fabrics door lining picks up any dead cells on your skin (elbows), or traces of make up foundation on your wife (daughter, girfriend, mum) fingers and requires constant attention (cleaning), RAV4 plastic, is better.Seats on both are equally good and comfortable, really nothing between them.Rear view camera – during the day Honda's camera is slightly better, at night RAV4s camera takes the honours, and then some. At total dark and with your reverse lights on – it's spectacular. Honda's is between so-so and meh.Rear bench space great in both cars. RAV4 rear door opening angle is like any other car/suv, on CRV it's almost 90 degrees, something you'll love if you often have small kids / baby seats or elderly people in your car.Boot, about the same. CRV VTI-S has power door at the back, something I've learned to hate. It's slow and painful to wait, my RAV4 GXL has normal boot door and I like it better that way.Noise – road, engine, wind – no difference in my opinion. Probably when coasting RAV4 is a bit quieter as you really can't hear the engine at all. When you push them hard, RAV is a bit louder, but we're splitting hairs here.Driving performance – I think RAV4 is somewhat livelier, although Honda is just fine as well. I had some doubts before I bought it 2 years ago, but having had Golf VI and VII with 1.4 Turbo engines I was comfortable with it and it performs well.Highway speed and grunt with car full of people and holiday gear – neither of them is Golf GTI and you don't want to push it with your dearest all in the car anyway. Which one is better in that sense – probably RAV4, but only slightly.Handling, steering, cornering – all about the same. Honda's brakes are very touchy, you just put your foot on it and it bites really hard before you even press, RAV4 is a bit more civilised.I would say so far they are really on par, total draw score, but then ...Things that Honda lacks and RAV4 has:Active cruise control, collision avoidance system that looks for cars, pedestrians and cyclists, road sign recognition camera (reads the speed limit and shows it in your dashboard and can warn you if you're going too fast, if you want so), rear side radars, when reversing and somoene is coming from the side and camera doesn't see it, the radar does. Go to Bunnings car park for 10 minutes and you will appreciate this thing no end. Then there is lane departure warning and steering correction, auto high beam management ... I'm sure there are quite a few other safety things on this list, Honda has none. All these things added up make a big difference.Honda has speed limiter, though, I don't think RAV4 has it.  RAV4 has puddle light, this is the light that is in the bottomo f your seide mirrors, super handy at night. I didn't even know about it until a few days into ownership.Now let's talk about Hybrid. It's so damn nice to drive, soo seemless and such a clever system. Fuel consumption difference between the two cars is night and day.I drive from SW suburbs of Brisbane to West End to work every day. 50km round trip.Honda's consumption was constantly 7.9l/100km (measured over long period). I had Xtrail diesel in recent months and that one was averaging 9.3l/100km for doing the exactly same.RAV4 so far, and I don't see a reason why it would change, is 5.1l/100km.Take that – almost 40% more fuel efficient than CRV and almost 50% better than Xtrail diesel.In marketing language – Honda needs almost 60% more fuel to travel the same distance.So if I could keep only one of these two cars now, it would be RAV4 without hesitation.",2020-Mar-8,whrl.pl/Rf1vBg
"Nellyxy writes...Would anyone recommend maybe getting a 2-3 year old more premium model?RAV4 – no. The previous model is rubbish when compared to CRV.

We had it for a weekend and my wife is tempted to sell CRV and get new Seltos, not the entry level model, but the one just above.It's one hell of a car, although slightly smaller than RAV4 or CRV, but not as small as HRV, CH-R or Qashqai.

Picked up our new rav 4 hybrid this week (white 2wd cruiser) was ordered 30th August 2019. All I can say for everyone waiting it’s SO WORTH THE WAIT. I am not a car person and I just love this car. Hang in there if you can!!! Dealer is saying that times will be closer to 8-9 months now with the whole Coronavirus dilemmas.  We got the white and it looks super swish with the black wheels and very dark windows. Don’t bother with the dealer tinted windows they come very dark anyway ( privacy dark and apparently if they were to be done here you Couldn’t get them that dark anyway) it’s just the driver and passenger that’s normal.Well done Toyota,2020-Mar-14,whrl.pl/Rf1IOM

"Hi all.    I have the RAV4 Petrol GXL (2020) and I'm having some weird issues with the inbuilt Sat Nav.It seems to be avoiding any route that includes toll roads.  For example, I needed to take the car back to Springwood (QLD) last week for its 1 month service.  If I google map from my house to Springwood, it estimates at about 30 minutes, taking the Logan motorway (toll road).  However – when I plug the same details into the RAVs sat nav, the shortest possible route is 52 minutes and doesn't take the toll road at all.I thought that maybe the default setting was to avoid tolls, but I've searched the manual and played with the system and can't find anything  that shows this as a default and lets me change it.  I also looked at the '3 route' option on the Sat Nav – but every single one of the 3 routes avoids the toll road so its not like its even bringing it up as an option.   I don't think its an outdated map or service update that's required, because the Logan motorway is not a new road and has been around for years, plus my car is only a month old (2020 build).I know that I can just use google maps through my phone – but I want to be able to use the inbuilt sat nav .

Thanks for any replies or advice on this!",2020-Mar-30,whrl.pl/Rf2rxO

On the left there of the screen there should be a few icons.  The 4th from the top – not sure what the picture is supposed to be of ( it is the one above the speaker with a line through it).  It should show ROUTE OPTIONS , then select PREFERENCE and under SELECT WHICH ROUTE TO ALLOW, select $TOLL ROADS (its hard to see on mine but a blue vertical line on the left of the text confirms that the option is selected.

When the petrol motor kicked in you well and truly new about it. Mind you I had no experience with them in the past. Also the test I drove had a noticeable ""whine "" when slowing down.

"The question needs to be asked why isn't a full size spare available on all grades as an option for drivers who need it, not just the GX.To force owners who want a full sized spare wheel to pay extortionate prices is definitely a con.Your location and lifestyle may not warrant a full sized spare. Mine does.1. The wasted boot space amounts to a two inch layer over the tyre2. The difference in mass is about 2.7 kg more – not a major impost on fuel economy3. I am suggesting an optional purchase.

"With the spare tyre thing, 2.7kg might not sound great to you but multiply that across the hundreds of thousand cars around the world and multiply the extra usage of oil needed to cart around that, it is a massive impact to the global oil consumption for just one model. This also flows into the cost saving going to a space saver vs full sized tyre.Give you an example. I had to a cost cutting improvement that dropped the cost of spraying under the parcel shelf on the local Camry/Aurion. Cost saving was 40c. When you multiply that across the 250k annual production (I'm sure the question was asked to the export team), it adds up for just one cost cut enough to pay for an additional person on the factory floor.Btw, the pricing structure of Toyota doesn't allow for a cost effective option over buying the same part as a spare part as it would be classed as another combination.. another SKU for one of the better term.Yes to the rest of the world, there's a lot of ""Why doesn't company x do.... ."" scenarios raised but the realities are, people are still buying even with a space saver, it's not big of an enough issue to warrant them doing something, and Toyota is bigger than the Titanic to turn. It sucks for people like you but you're just a small minority that actually give 2 hoots.I'd recommend buying the set of rims overseas (Jeese Streeter or Import Monster have been reliable for me), either keep the 3 as spares in case one of them gets kerbed/scratched.",2020-Apr-16,whrl.pl/Rf26k6

"I know that one of the reasons why people went for the AWD hybrid vs the FWD hybrid was because of the towing capacity of 1500kg vs 480kg. I had a hard time believing that with the extra electric motor, the car was able to tow three times more and the 2.5L hybrid tows less than the 2.0L petrol.So.... I did a bit of searching online, went to the toyota UK website and looked up their specifications sheet for their 2.5L FWD hybrid. And... lo and behold... their specifications is mostly the same except for the braked towing of 800kg. The UK rav4 is made in Japan as well.For reference:https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/rav4/features-and-specs/grade=a22e8ff1-47af-4cef-bffd-5a56d3f1d14a%7Cbodytype=30b0ef55-504f-4ce5-8f54-6856b2e8aa20I find 800kg logically more believable and wonder if Toyota Australia deliberately undervalued the towing capacity in Australia just to distinguish the AWD more.

It is also very good on fuel. I would drive it and see if you are happy with the performance, some 2.0 litre competitors are absolute shockers in this SUV segment.Just bare in mind you do get a couple more features on the GX hybrid like dual zone climate and smart start (but no smart entry which kinda defeats the purpose).

They probably give quotes like these literally hundreds of times a day.Make an offer with a price you're actually willing to pay (no tyre-kicking), and say you'll give them your CC details immediately if they accept. They might require a photo of your CC to prove you're serious, before even bothering to get up from their seat to get the OK from the manager on duty. This is the level of commitment you'll need to show in order to get the best price.Also, get the tints elsewhere. They'll cost $150 at most, but the dealership will charge you three times that amount for the luxury of them taking care of it for you.Mats and a tank of petrol should come free, no dealer should charge for them and they're stupid to lose a sale just because they don't chuck them in when it costs them <$100 cost price.",2020-Jun-21,whrl.pl/Rf5xO5

Today one Australian dollar buys 74 Japanese Yen, after dipping to 64 Japanese Yen in March 2020.Toyota – and most other car makers – have ridden the wave of currency fluctuations, but now it is passing some of the cost on to buyers.The Toyota price list shows hybrid models will rise by the greatest margin, as demand continues to exceed supply of petrol-electric variants.The Toyota Prius – which pioneered hybrid technology – will go up by $800.Currently the waiting list for a Toyota RAV4 Hybrid stretches up to 10 months, however Toyota has told CarAdvice it is trying to find a fairer way of allocating cars and shortening waiting lists.Interestingly, the Toyota RAV4 and Toyota C-HR are the only models where the price for both petrol and hybrid variants will increase by the same amount (by $1300 on the RAV4 and by $750 on the C-HR).In all other examples, the price increases for hybrid variants are $500 more than their equivalent petrol-only versions.See the full list below:Toyota Corolla hatchback petrol: up $560Toyota Corolla hatchback hybrid: up $1060Toyota Corolla sedan petrol: up $560Toyota Corolla sedan hybrid: up $1060Toyota Prius: up $800Toyota 86: up $740Toyota Camry petrol: up $700Toyota Camry hybrid: up $1200Toyota RAV4 petrol: up $1300Toyota RAV4 hybrid: up $1300Toyota LandCruiser 200: up $1170Toyota Hiace: up $1100Toyota Hiace Commuter: up $1100Toyota Granvia: up $1100Toyota C-HR: up $750Toyota C-HR hybrid: up $750",2020-Jun-23,whrl.pl/Rf5A2Z

"Something that might interest those who have recently changed from Nutmeg to black interior or are still awaiting their Nutmeg build (interesting stuff).For the months of June and July, we have had a much-anticipated increase in the supply of RAV4 Hybrid to assist us in clearing the backlog of COSIs outstanding in the network and allowing stock vehicles to be made available for the network.Whilst we have been making our production side aware of requirements to clear COSIs with the rapid rise of production made available to TMCA, our production facilities have been unable to increase the level of Cruiser LA40 Nutmeg interior trims at the speed that overall production has increased.Unfortunately, this LA40 Nutmeg trim restriction was only realized after pulling forward the August and September vehicles into July production (as per region planning bulletin RP 018/20).Due to the limited production of Nutmeg interior we had to push many COSIs we could not fill with production from July into August production (where they remain at A00).As such when produced, these will be a Tech Change vehicle and be subjected to GPI and any spec change related price increase. In the interests of the guests, TMCA will exercise discretion and not apply the GPI or any spec related price increase for the COSIs created by 18th June (date new tech change material code went live in SAP) for RAV4 HV Cruisers LA40 Nutmeg trim.",2020-Jul-6,whrl.pl/Rf53Bn

"So test-drove a GX Hybrid FWD yesterday, the pick-up was smooth however I drive with a heavy foot and could hear the car struggling under hard acceleration (also some kind very slight vibration could be felt) but when back to cruising speeds, everything good. ECO mode felt the smoothest. Could it be the test car I drove or is this how the CVT works? ( have no prior experience of driving a CVT).Why would one go for AWD over FWD and vice versa – does the slight power uptake 160/163 matters OR are there some other benefits that I have overlooked? The car would be primarily be used for school pick up and drop-offs and in a few years for my son who would turn 16. I was quoted $46500 for Cruiser FWD non-metallic, with Dashcam, mats, a tank full, and $49,500 for Cruiser AWD metallic -DA – Car in stock (both white – Sydney). Are these good prices – white is not my color of choice but the partner likes it.Really impressed with the space in the car. it's a bummer that the passenger side has no electric seat adjustments (even after spending >$45k??)

I'm thinking an upgrade to the battery in the RAV4 is becoming more likely with the 'new model' in Sept 2020.https://www.caradvice.com.au/866231/2021-toyota-camry-new-infotainment-advanced-safety-here-next-year/?source=carousel&slot=0The upgrade to the Toyota Camry’s hybrid battery pack will be fitted to the current model as a running change from next month, and will flow into the 2021 model.The current 245V nickel metal hydride battery pack (paired to a 2.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine) will be replaced with a new more efficient 259V lithium-ion battery pack and will take up no more space than current arrangement.",2020-Jul-16,whrl.pl/Rf6p0A

"Hi folks,Can you check my math below please. Something does not make sense to me... The guys in US test drove the new RAV4 Prime PHEV in a mixed driving pattern circle. The video is here:https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=9TBjGRR-8kkHe basically started with nearly full charge of 18KWh hybrid battery and full fuel tank, drove for 71.3 miles, and topped up the fuel tank with 0.821gallon of petrol, then calculated the consumption as 0.821/71.3 => 86.8 miles from one US gallon (the guy actually calculated 89, I don't know how, but it is close enough), which in our terms converts to a stunning 2.64L/100km.However, he finished with the pretty much empty hybrid battery, so the cost of charging the 18KWh battery should be added. Considering the efficiency of the charger, let's say we need 20KWh from the power outlet. Note that's for 71.3 miles (115km). For 100km, we would need 17.5KWh.I compared the current prices of petrol (0.73US$/L) and electricity (0.15US$/KWh) in Colorado, so roughly 5KWh is equivalent of 1L of fuel, in terms of consumption cost, and therefore 17.5KWh required charge equates to extra 3.5L of petrol per 100km. For Sydney, those numbers would be as follows:The current price of petrol is (1.2AU$/L) and electricity is (0.3AU$/KWh) , so roughly 4KWh is equivalent of 1L of fuel, in terms of consumption cost, and therefore 17.5KWh required charge equates to extra 4.3L of petrol per 100km.So, after you add (even in Colorado) those extra 3.5L/100km to the calculated 2.64L/100km, you'll end up with over 6L/100km. In Sydney, it works out close to 7.In my Cruiser Hybrid, I am easily getting 5.7 and many others here reported less.What's the point in PHEV if it works out to be less efficient? Ecology?Or maybe my math is wrong? Am I missing something? Maybe if you charge at the dedicated charge station, the KWh will cost you much less?Please comment.",2020-Jul-18,whrl.pl/Rf6vLf

"My fuel economy has been fluctuating wildly – anywhere from as low as 4.3L/100km to 6.3L/100km. In total, averaging about 5.8-5.9L/100km total over the 700km or so I’ve driven it.From my experiences so far I notice the following trends:1) If you park your car outside or undercover and don’t have a proper garage, the fuel economy in Winter is significantly worse as EV mode is fairly reluctant to kick in until after a few minutes. For longer trips, it wouldn’t make much difference, but in city driving for maybe 10-20km, it drops your fuel economy noticeably. When I park my car inside the proper garage, this effect is usually much less and I find that it stays in EV mode much earlier/the car can actually use EV mode only at the beginning.2) Slow acceleration for the purposes of keeping the gauge in the ECO area didn’t improve fuel economy much for me – I found that if I accelerate normally (not rushing off the lights, mind, just regular acceleration to keep pace with most cars), it would be about the same or sometimes better fuel economy. Not entirely sure why, but I suspect it might be because I get up to speed quicker and then can relax the throttle to get EV mode to appear significantly quicker.The trips where I had 4.3-5.3L/100km were usually not in morning, and were significantly flatter/downhill compared to the 6+L/100km results, which were almost always in the morning cold, or hillier terrain.My overall fuel economy is mid to high 5L/100km so I’m still really happy with the fuel economy overall. My old Corolla with a 1.8L engine and the kerb weight of a modern Yaris was using 10L/100km on the same work commute! Old engines suck for fuel economy ☹",2020-Aug-6,whrl.pl/Rf7cdV
"Point 1 is a bit mixed. If you start from cold (garage or not), before the coolant warms up to 40C, it will primarily draw from the battery for motive power (waiting for more detail to see how many amps it is drawing but it is higher than normal) despite the engine running coz it’s busy warming up. My morning ritual is to warm up the car till it cuts out (@40C) and then drive it. It only takes a minute at most which is really quick vs Prius.Point 2: What your describing is the pulse and glide method to hypermiling. Youtube the method for how the Prius gang have mastered.Separately what I do notice is the RAV4 4WD (not sure if it’s applicable to FWD given the extra MGR motor) is it rarely uses the friction brakes until it is around 5km/h and below.

"SmellyTofu writes...Point 2: What your describing is the pulse and glide method to hypermiling. Youtube the method for how the Prius gang have mastered.Yeah I've heard of pulse and glide hypermiling and how it works, but I probably don't do the accelerate and coast thing as much as the proper hypermilers. I usually just accelerate to the speed limit and then come off the throttle a bit (to only something like 5-10% pressure on the pedal) to encourage it to stay in EV mode instead of using the combustion engine. I tried pulse and glide but wasn't a huge fan of constantly speeding up and slowing down (even though it's probably better for fuel efficiency in a hybrid).",2020-Aug-6,whrl.pl/Rf7cKe

The thing is the hybrid is in that sweet spot of power to weight ratio of over 95kW/ton (my rule of thumb is anything over 85kW/ton is sufficient for everyday driving). Nothing wrong with the 2.0 (77kW/ton) for around town purposes but you need to be a tiny bit conscious of its limitation and limited range particularly if you’re trying to only refill on the cheap days spaced roughly 14 days apart.,2020-Aug-6,whrl.pl/Rf7d6O

"Shadovv writes...I really wish we could get the two tone ones in Australia – the white with black roof option they get in the states looks pretty good with the black wheels.Funnily enough, I saw one last week on the road – white with the black roof (probably aftermarket wrap). Despite that I would have likely tended to agree with you before I saw that one, about benefits of playing on contrast, what I saw in reality I didn't like at all – it looked severely overloaded visually with black.  Mind you, the existing black trim where the roofrails are plus some other black elements already create enough contrast, together with the black wheels. Adding the black roof is definitely an overkill, in my opinion. I was considering getting the black roof wrapping done on my pearl Cruiser. Not anymore, after what I saw.",2020-Aug-21,whrl.pl/Rf7JEd

I presume because the rears are driven by electric motor?. and if you can manually set it it would chew up power.The AWD comes on and off as the car sees fit, as the other dude up there quoted from the manual -Brian McGee writes...Examples of conditions where the system will switch to AWD are when cornering, going uphill, starting off or acceler- ating, and when the road surface is slippery due to snow, rain, etc.That basically all the time you would ever need it? If you are just cruising and maintaining speed it will just deliver enough power to the front wheels to do so. It's all about efficiency.The heads up info will show you when it's delivering electric or petrol power and to front or rear and I can tell you the rears do get used all the time in standard driving conditions. I really suggest going for a test drive if your dealers are open still, you can see it in action. It shows the power delivery of electric/petrol to front/rear and when battery is recharging etc.Accelerating to 50kph gently will be all 4 wheels, battery only, generally I find with maintaining speed with traffic my petrol motor will come on around 30kph, but it's being supplemented with the hybrid battery to both front and back (for fuel saving). When you get up to speed the motor will turn off again and just cruise on electric. Majority of driving I have done is in 50, 70 and 80kph zones. 0-30 = electric, 30 – 80 = petrol. Cruising at 50, 70 or 80 it goes back to electric only with just a bit of power to front wheels, accelerating a bit more the rears might get a bit, but slightly harder than that the petrol motor will kick in again (which only delivers power to front wheels).I don't think it would cruise on battery only at 100kph but I've not really done highway driving in it yet to confirm. If the majority of your driving is at those higher speeds you could possibly be better off just getting the non-hybrid 2L? Not really sure.I'm really happy with my GXL AWD :)",2020-Aug-21,whrl.pl/Rf7KzT

"I find that when I am coasting along on a flat road in the hybrid the needle drops from the economy zone to the very top of the ""charge"" zone on the dash (ie. its about 1mm from the top of the charge zone). But when I apply the brakes it drops to the middle of the ""charge"" zone. I would have thought more charging would be happening when the needle is at the top of the ""charge"" zone so why does the needle drop lower in the charge zone upon regenerative braking?

having more hybrids out there hopefully removes the stigma and resistance to the change. Plus it’d ease the stock constraints and provide a competitive environmentCompletely agree – more competition means we all get our Rav4s cheaper and/or with less of the issues (eg. reverse camera screen that is useless 50% of the time). I think Honda stuffed up by not bringing the hybrid CRV to AU. Even if they took 10% of toyota rav 4 hybrid sales they would have been selling approx 200-400 hybrids per month over the past 6 months (important sales for a company rumoured to be struggling). If they bring it out now they will be competing with the Ford Escape hybrid (due out next month) and tuscon next year which I think will be very popular. The forester hybrid needs a serious rethink urgently.,2020-Aug-26,whrl.pl/Rf7WgH
"I'm not actually sure if the gauge means anythingyes I am probably overthinking it :) I get a bit bored driving sometimes... alternatively I could be thinking about it wrong – the lower you go in the ""ECO"" or ""PWR"" zones the less fuel you use... so maybe the same is true in the ""CHG"" zone (I know you are not using fuel in the ""CHG"" zone but the same principle – the lower in the zone the more efficient you are?)Its a novelty at the moment to stay <5L/100km (currently where I live its perfect temperatures – so no need for AC or heating) so I am stuck on 5L/100km (only done 1000km so far though). I am sure I will revert to the 5-6L/100km in summer – still amazing efficiency for the weight of the car!",2020-Aug-26,whrl.pl/Rf7Wih
WeRpLe writes...think Honda stuffed up by not bringing the hybrid CRV to AU.Yeah thats interesting.. I was tossing up getting a Honda CRV or a Rav4.  I eventually went with the Rav 4 purely because it was a hybrid.  So it may have been swayed to the Honda camp if they had a Hybrid for me to consider.I get the impression that Honda just aren't interested in the Australian Market anymore.  There were rumours that they were looking to exit completely.. one of the dealers confirmed that whilst they aren't existing completely they are moving towards where they no longer have exclusive showrooms anymore..  Its a shame.. I would have thought that they still had a lot of potential in the AUS market and am somewhat confused but this approach..,2020-Aug-26,whrl.pl/Rf7Wja

When I explained it to them they said it wouldn't come here because we didn't have the charging infrastructure.  I think they thought it was like a Tesla despite me telling them it was closer to the current hybrids just with a bigger battery.Toyota Australia didn't believe that anyone would want one here back in December 2019.  Maybe that has changed since they sold more Rav4 hybrids than their nearest competitor sold across all vehicles last month.  Maybe that has just confirmed what they originally thought.https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-news/fastest-ever-rav4-wont-make-it-to-australia-as-toyota-pulls-plug-on-plug-in-hybrids-77333,2020-Aug-26,whrl.pl/Rf7Xk6

Mass per Volume.  Higher octane components in fuel have a higher density as the molecules pack closer together due to their shape.  With E10, the ethanol has a lower density than the base fuel which is why the fuel economy is lower.Yes. Octane is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self ignition when compressed in the cylinder.  RON is actually the octane measured without load.  MON (Motor Octane Number) is an equivalent measure with the engine under load.At no point did I state that Octane is related to the energy content of the fuel.  It isn't.

My understanding is the base fuels imported from SG is low sulphur but somehow Aussie fuels have at least >30ppm. Is it that the mix of Australian sources oil is the cause of it?Sulphur is present in crude oil.  Some have a lot, some don't have much.  To meet our fuel specs (particularly diesel) you need to have equipment to remove it.  We used to be near the front in terms of specs but have fallen way behind.  The Australian refineries date back to the 1950s/1960s and while they have been upgraded regularly their owners have invested just enough to meet our local fuel specifications.  When the specs were introduced it was thought that new vehicles would required 95/98 RON fuel (that's what the car manufacturers were saying). So the sulphur of 91 RON was left at 150 ppm as it was thought that it would die out over time.  Once the industry was on 95/98 at 500 ppm then the specs would drop to 10 ppm at some point in the future.  That obviously hasn't happened.Many refineries in Asia are newer and many are built for export so have invested to meet international fuel specs.  We mostly import from the Asian region.  So imported fuel will generally have lower sulphur than locally made.  There is some talk about moving to 10ppm on petrol again but its going to require several hundred millions dollars of investement (more sulphur removal) across the local refineries to achieve it.NSW has no local refineries any more and is generally supplied with imports so you may find that the imported fuel could be as low as 10 ppm across all grades.  I can't say that for sure but I've seen Certificates of Quality for imports with very low sulphur levels as the refineries don't generally change their setup for the small quantities coming to Australia.",2020-Sep-10,whrl.pl/Rf8vmb

"Brian McGee writes...In percentage terms you are correct, but in dollar terms, for me it's about an extra $60 a year (even before accounting for the increased fuel mileage) which is peanuts.My post was not intended to rebut or take any side on any side of the decision for anyone to use higher RON than manufacturer specified levels. It was only intended to give quantitative information relating to the claim that you could offset a ""significant"" amount of the cost with the ""increased mileage"". By putting numbers to the claims, others are able to make a decision relating to the terms used which are otherwise vague.You have made the decision based upon your own usage and whilst I think we can all agree that $60/year additional cost to use a higher grade of fuel is small, others may not have the same sort of usage and may expect that a 10% increase in price would equate to a similar increased distance covered, by volume; closer to 10% than say 5%. This is particularly a sticking point for myself because the delta between 98 and 91 RON is almost constant at 20c, but the price of 91 has dropped significantly, so the jump to 98 RON is a significantly greater cost, as a %.In a similar topic of discussion, using E10 for a constant 3cpl discount would only make sense (in my opinion) once the price of fuel drops below 90cpl so that as a %, you aren't losing mileage without a corresponding discount of a similar amountUsing higher RON fuels has many benefits such as reducing harmful emissions, potentially keeping sensors and equipment cleaner for longer and if the car is tuned for it, will see greater than above figures claimed if the ignition is retarded to increase power output.

"rjjs writes...Maybe you don't hang around for a RAV4 because everybody's getting one-Warning – long technological rant incoming:I've been a member of the Toyota hybrid fan club ever since I bought my Prius 10 years ago. My interest stems from my profession – electrical engineering.The Toyota hybrid system debuted in the 1st gen Prius in 1997 – 23 years ago. The system remains unchanged in concept to this day. Bigger motors, batteries, different packaging, yes, but the original mechanism of operation has remained unchanged.To this day, no other system comes close to the combination of low cost/real world fuel economy/extreme longevity/robustness that Toyota have accomplished.The Rosetta Stone that Toyota developed was the Power Split Device. This is the center of the transaxle arrangement that is able to manage the power interactions of the two Motor/Generators, the ICE, the battery and the hybrid system controller. It's kind of like a planetary gearset inside of another planetary gearset, a bunch of constantly meshed gears sitting in an oil bath, no friction materials, no engagement and disengagement of gears, no axial or perpendicular movement. Here is an informative (but slightly boring) video of how it functions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLNDGUISTYMThe end result of this is a system that, besides the battery and ICE, never wears out. Like, ever. There's nothing to wear out. Legions of Camry and Prius taxis with 600,000km+ are testament to this, as well as my own 315,000km Prius which drives as the day I bought it. (Putting aside the 1st gen Prius from 1997-2003 which had undersized motors that burnt out around 400,000km).Why the rant you ask? Well, other manufacturers don't have access to the PSD unless they license it from Toyota. That's expensive. So they develop lame systems like this:https://www.caradvice.com.au/836054/2020-subaru-forester-hybrid-2-0e-s-review/and this:https://www.caradvice.com.au/869255/2020-mazda-3-x20-astina-skyactiv-x-m-hybrid-review/I fear the Hyundai/Kia system is more of the same. I know they use conventional 6&8 speed autos for power transmission (DCT's for the PHEV's). They won't last nearly as long, they'll be more problematic over their (shorter) lifespan and they will probably have inferior real world economy.If you're the type that buys new, dealer services and gives it the flick at year 6 of the 7 year warranty (channelling you here rjjs) you'll probably be fine I guess, minus the inferior fuel consumption. As a longer term prospect, why not get the crème de la crème of hybrid systems, proven more than 15 million times over 23 years. Do it once, do it right I say.(No offence to Hyundai/Kia lovers, they're generally fine cars otherwise)",2020-Sep-20,whrl.pl/Rf8WQd

There are other aspects of the system that benefit fuel economy that I won’t go into, but you should expect around 6L/100km on the highway according to owners.

Based on THS, Toyota later developed a new single-row planetary gear configuration [6]'Who did Toyota license it from?Themselves, see this patent filed by Toyota in 1996 entitled 'Hybrid vehicle drive system having two motor/generator units and engine starting means':https://patents.google.com/patent/US5934395A/enIt is true that there were similar designs before this one, but Toyota figured out a method to start the ICE using one of the motor/generators, whereas previous designs did not. In addition, Toyota's system does away with several clutches and has lower mechanical losses. In the 24 years since filing, nobody has figured out a better system that doesn't infringe on the Toyota patents.Toyota has many other patents, such as the development of advanced IGBT's (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors) that improved the performance of their hybrid inverter to world's best at the time, but that's another topic.Miller cycle not Atkinson.While the Atkinson and Miller Cycles share the delayed closing of the intake valve, Toyota don't use a supercharger as required by the Miller Cycle, therefore it is standard Atkinson cycle:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cycle'As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_cycle'In the late 20th century, the term ""Atkinson cycle"" began to be used to describe a modified Otto-cycle engine—in which the intake valve is held open longer than normal, allowing a reverse flow of intake air into the intake manifold. This ""simulated"" Atkinson cycle is most notably used in the Toyota 1NZ-FXE engine from the early Prius.'There you go, you've learnt the difference between the two cycles today, you're welcome! I can explain the Otto cycle for you as well if you wish to learn.I never achieved those numbers with my Corolla hybrid.That's because your Corolla hybrid, if you really do have one, has a higher drag coefficient and larger frontal area than the economy focused Prius (0.25 vs 0.30-32):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficientNo need to apologise, you ain't bursting anyone's bubble...",2020-Sep-21,whrl.pl/Rf8Yo4

"Mucchan writes...Shouldn't these patents expire by now  though?Patents are funny and often complex things. There are related patents that expire from 2024-2036 that are integral to the improvements that Toyota have made over the years. Technically, a manufacturer could build a hybrid system identical to the 1997 Prius, but they wouldn't be able to incorporate most of the improvements since then, which would make them uncompetitive relative to Toyota's current models. This forces them to use a significantly different design, as Toyota have engaged in continuous improvement on that particular hybrid design.My first rant about the Power Split Device greatly simplified the current patent situation for brevity, it's much more complex than just that particular technology, even though it is a lynchpin of the design. For example, up until the 2016 Prius, the transaxle assembly was axially mounted on a single shaft, after that they split the Motor/Generators (and PSD) onto parallel shafts, allowing for a significantly more compact design. This is just one of many improvements they've made and patented, which prevent anybody else from using a PSD in that particular configuration.Basically, they're so far ahead on hybrid technology that other manufacturers will have to leapfrog them straight to EV's if they want to compete.",2020-Sep-21,whrl.pl/Rf8Zqq

Mucchan writes...full EV since they're quite late to the partyI don't think so.. Full EV will be a very simple change...

"InternalBleeding writes...I wouldn't be surprised if toyota is pretty much ready to go.. All they are waiting for is better batteries or way of charging themPersonally, I don't think they're waiting for anything, I reckon they're furiously working on better batteries as we speak. There's a book called 'The Prius that Shook the World' by Hideshi Itazaki (you can google the PDF, 7th link in the google result, Priuschat forum) and in it the author describes how they partnered with Panasonic to make the worlds most power dense, reliable and compact NiMH battery at the time, because nothing was commercially available that had the desired performance characteristics for the Prius.Of course, at the time, all the other manufacturers were asleep at the wheel regarding emissions and fuel economy, so Toyota had the field to themselves. Things are a little different now, emissions/fuel econ are everything and competition is fierce.

"Tyrial7 writes...Hi all. Just ordered a Hybrid AWD Cruiser in Atomic Rush with Nutmeg interior and towkit. Came to $48650 D/A, expected delivery Nov 30th. Bought from Cessnock Toyota, I said i wanted it for under $49000, and they came straight back with that price, no haggling back and forth.Thanks again for sharing the deal you got. I got a similar deal thanks to you.I had been in contact with brokering service called Georgie, but managed to get a better deal by speaking to a dealer directly. Originally, I put in an enquiry through the Auto Expert motoring news/reviews website run by John Cadogan, after seeing all of John's promises of ""saving thousands off the price of a new car"". After I filled out the online form, I was called by a broker from Georgie, who said I had been referred to them by Auto Expert.RRP for AWD Hybrid Cruiser with towbar and premium paint was circa $52,500. The best quote received back from the broker was $49,500, ($3k or 5.7% discount). I told the broker that their best quote was still higher than what I had expected and that I'd ""seen people on forums get better deals recently"".Upon hearing this, the car broker agent warned me that not everyone posting online is 100% honest, that some users like to big-note themselves and exaggerate the deals they got to look cool, and finally that some forum posters might be referring to prices before on-road costs...Anyway, using a Tyrial7's price as a guide, I was able to negotiate a similar price with a dealer directly, $48,500 including tow bar/ball/wiring and premium paint. $4k or 7.6% discount on a car that is basically sold out everywhere, pretty happy.Two things to note: Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts. Secondly, car brokers won't always be able to get you the best deal. I think that the prices through the broker are a bit higher because the dealer has to pay the broker a ""finder's fee"" for your business.",2020-Sep-22,whrl.pl/Rf81WI
"intrasonic writes...Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts.I agree. One broker I dealt with didn't believe the price I got (was almost borderlining on rude when I told them). Back in March when there was a 8 month wait, I got the RAV4 Cruiser Hybrid for $45.5k D/A. It pays to put in the hard yards and call several dealers.Brokers need to charge a commission/fee which means money in their pocket, not yours.",2020-Sep-22,whrl.pl/Rf81XB

I got a similar deal thanks to you.Fantastic, glad I could help!Originally, I put in an enquiry through the Auto Expert motoring news/reviews website run by John CadoganThat's so surreal, I did exactly the same thing and got a very similar price from Georgie, I probably should have mentioned that in my original post.Firstly, even on cars where demand exceeds the supply, you can still get discounts.Yep. There was one on the forecourt that matched my spec minus the nutmeg interior, I asked 'how much for that one?' He said 'I got it in yesterday and sold it today at RRP'. Don't expect to get a discount for floor stock at this point, but build to order is just cream for the dealer – think about it, there's no holding costs for them, it just goes into a queue, gets built, comes in and they give it to you minus their nominal profit. Then they get a chance at dealer servicing and repairs over the life of the car, especially if the customer got a good deal from them.Secondly, car brokers won't always be able to get you the best deal.Yep again.I was able to negotiate a similar price with a dealer directly, $48,500 including tow bar/ball/wiring and premium paint. $4k or 7.6% discount on a car that is basically sold out everywhere, pretty happy.Very nice, when is your estimated delivery date?",2020-Sep-22,whrl.pl/Rf811p

This gives great fuel economy, the hybrid will probably use about 5-6L/100km in that type of driving, while the standard petrol will do about 9-10L/100km.That being said, with the very low km you will be doing, the standard petrol one would probably be fine.Source: have owned a Toyota hybrid for 10 years.",2020-Sep-25,whrl.pl/Rf9aL6

"Hi everyone,I am up for the 12 months service on my Cruiser (bought October last year, complimentary was done in Nov 2019, and they fitted AA/ACP back then too).Anyone went through that service yet? Anything specific I need to know? The part reason I am asking is I've just booked it for next Thurs (with the same mob who did complimentary), and tried to request the Android Auto update to the latest revision, but was told that there were no AA updates since it was installed in November 2019. Is that right? How was yours serviced?Also, they advised that the set of navigation maps upgrade would be $300+ if I want it. On the top of the service cost. Are they trying to rip me off?

With your free spirit personality, you would be most likely to upgrade to a Hybrid Corolla.Volcanic RedYou’re straight-up fire and a confident sass ball.  You’re happy to stand out and kinda enjoy the attention. And yes, you truly believe that your Corolla goes faster than everyone else’s because it’s red.

You love your new Corolla!Oxide BronzeYou’re an individual who dares to be different but is trendy and sophisticated at the same time. Your idea of a perfect day is jumping in the car and heading to Brisbane for a day of shopping and then dinner and drinks with friends. You’re the type of person who can’t wait to get a hold of the latest tech and thinks that the wireless charging feature in the Corolla ZR is the best thing EVER!!!Glacier WhiteIf you drive a white car, you're probably someone who values the simple things in life above all else.  You are motivated to achieve success but the meaning of success to you isn’t only a successful career, it is also having an easy and balanced life. Your phone is always connected to your Corolla’s Bluetooth, as you can’t live without your daily dose motivation and wisdom from your favourite lifestyle podcasts.Peacock BlueThis Corolla is dark and mysterious. You’re a night cruiser and enjoy heading up the Maleny range to check out the lights. You also can’t get enough of the ambient illumination inside your Corolla which makes you feel like rockstar.

The newly designed front seats hold firm, created to help minimise stress and heighten your overall comfort.

"Sri, floor mats are standard, side step and nudge bar, you can have for $48500 or less if you negotiate. Full tank is also standard. $51K is a no deal. Considering standard RRP is ~ 52K. I was offered $47700 for Rav4 cruiser awd with floor mats ( this is standard) cargo mats, front window tint and weathershield. I added side step for $48500. I asked everyone around and was told $48500 is currently a going price and not special. So you can definately do better.My trick was I sent enquiries to every one on the last day of the month and told them this is $47700 is my offer and if they are interested they can call me. The next day first day of the month, literally everyone called me.

"It’s funny it’s a criticism, as when we had a Camry my wife had the exact opposite frustration. As it was a keyless car but when you unlocked the boot no other doors unlocked.So you get to the car, hands full of shopping and kids, unlock the boot to put stuff initially in the boot – including your nappy bag or bulky handbag, get to the passenger doors and they are still locked, so have to go back to the boot – fish out the keys out of the bags and then get the kids in. The other option is to keep the bag on you whilst in a tight car park and wrangling kids into their seats.She asked me about dozen times was there a wayfor the entire car to unlock when you unlock the boot from behind",2020-Oct-18,whrl.pl/Rf94mw
"2 Engine:I think you are missing the point. But maybe I am. In a case of keyless entry such as with this RAV4 (I am not sure what your Camry does, but assume it would do the same), when the key is in proximity to the car, all doors remain locked until you actually touch any door handle. I can come close to the locked car and watch that light go on, but if I then leave the scene without touching any handles, the car doors remain locked, and that is the way it should be.In your example, when you put your stuff into the boot first, and then try to open the side doors, they should surely open no problems, as the key is nearby. So, they are ""pre-unlocked"" by the key proximity, but won't fully unlock until you touch the handle. I don't know why they didn't open in your description. They should have.My issue is that when I open and then close only the boot on the previously fully locked car, and I don't touch any side doors handles in the process and then walk away, so the key is no longer in proximity, still anyone can come to the car and open the side doors – they are unlocked, even though I have not touched any of them.Summary: opening and closing the boot without touching the side doors leaves them permanently unlocked even when the key is not in proximity, which I reckon is a serious flaw.",2020-Oct-18,whrl.pl/Rf94n7

"Wow... It looks like I almost started a little boot hollywar.Another brilliant idea visited me today (I haven't opened the door to it, but it left me a written message :)The principal difference in door locking behaviour between sedan and SUV is that for the latter, if the boot is unlocked, you can get inside the salon and open any door you want from inside, whereas for the former, you can not get to the salon from inside the boot. (Maybe also for that reason, that boot door in SUVs is actually called a rear door, not a boot).So, obviously, if your SUV's rear door is unlocked, there is no point keeping the other four locked, as that would not provide any extra security to the car innards, so Toyota decided to unlock them too anyway for SUV. Sedan is a different story, and keeping its salon locked when the boot is unlocked, makes a perfect sense, as you can only open the boot from the salon, but not vice versa.",2020-Oct-18,whrl.pl/Rf95Gl

I have both an LX and an SX (and prior to this a cheap ebay BT one), and have worked with pretty much anything (including Lexus HSD which I guess is what you're after). I use the USB version for those increased read rates, but the BT one worked well too.

"Hi all,Had a strange thing happened to me today in my Cruiser 2WD Hybrid (purchased Oct 2019).I was in the car by myself. Stopped it at the kerb and got out of the car to get something – left the engine running and gears to ""P"" (car beeped three times when I closed the door from outside, warning me that the engine's still on).  I was absent for 5 min, then I returned to the car, got in, shifted the gear to ""D"" and started slowly moving in EV mode – I only needed to make about 200m to the place where the car was going to be parked, so didn't bother putting my seat belt on. Soon the car started dinging signalling that the seat belt is not fastened. I didn't buckle up, and put the gas pedal down a bit, but the car did not accelerate and just kept just rolling.  I then fastened a seat belt (the car stopped dinging), and tried to accelerate again, but to no avail.

"I work in the Insurance Claims industry (not motor vehicles) so will claim some knowledge. Insurance is probably the purest form of getting what you pay for, factoring in all known risks. It is rather like gambling, with the Underwriter having a huge body of knowledge of the risks involved to help them determined the odds that they offer for differing risks.That can extend to some odd things beyond the obvious ones. Parking on the street is riskier than in your driveway, which is riskier than being in a carport, which is riskier than a locked garage. If your office car park is secure (as mine is) , it is less risky than parking on the street or an open park.Age and driving experience, together with your home and workplace address are obvious modifiers of risk, but you would not intuitively think of things like paint colour. A plain colour is easier to repair, with pearl white especially tricky (and more expensive), so a pearl white car is noticeably pricier to insure from some insurers than a plain white one.The prime thing you should worry about when buying insurance is the quality of service when a claim occurs. There is an excellent comparison site to help you look at the quality of different Insurance products https://www.claimscomparison.com/",2020-Nov-3,whrl.pl/RgaG3m

"""anyone know how accurate or far off the tracking website is""Excluding WA (independent distributor) vehicle tracking is updated in real time and reflects TMCA's system. Vehicle tracking only shows about 6 different statuses whereas a Dealers sees maybe 30 and TMCA about 50. For simplicity vehicle tracking statuses are grouped into areas relevant to a guest/customer. Sometimes a status can move through 6 changes in an hour. Calculating the customer eta on production is a very very complex formula. (I know as I worked fine tuning it for many years) The number of variables that can effect it is quite staggering. It can be as simple as 2 ships docking at the same time, or just one part not available when the vehicle is processed on the wharf because the delivery truck had an accident.  Add to that typhoons, shipments being quarantined, strikes, hail, vendors unable to supply on time, and that not even considering CO-VID19.

"lctan writes...I am thinking of just getting the petrol cruiser, simply because I need the car urgently in mid January. Moving to a new work, Any thoughts?Really depends on how much you drive and usage pattern.- If you drive a lot (20,000km+ per year) then you'll likely to reap the benefit of the fuel savings. Break even point is around 70,000-80,000km from what I've read.- Petrol Cruiser is ~30kW down on power compared to the Hybrid (131kW vs 160kW (2WD) or 163kW (AWD)) so it will struggle more in certain conditions.- Less towing capacity vs Hybrid AWD (800kg braked 750kg unbraked vs 1500kg braked 750kg unbraked on the Hybrid AWD) although still better compared to the Hybrid 2WD which can't really tow anything.Personally, I think even without considering the fuel savings and towing capability, the Hybrid will be the nicer car to drive because of the extra power.

Surely they could have improved upon this - Still haven't managed to turn off the voice and beeping when over the speed limit.

"Today I drove 300km (mix of highway and lots of roadwork/congestion speeds !) in my brand new Cruiser Hybrid.Good things:- Very easy to drive. Good visibility, and feels very nimble and car-like for its size.- Very smooth; plenty of grunt when needed without making a fuss about it, and really seamless power delivery. My previous car was a turbo diesel; the turbo diesel felt more effortless when climbing serious hills, but the hybrid's lack of turbo lag makes up for it- Coming from an older car, I'm enjoying CarPlay and the speed camera/school zone alerts (though it's annoying that the school zone alerts come on even outside of school hours)- Radar cruise control – awesome ! I can pretty much drive pedal-free :)Gripes:- The interior, and particularly the driver dash is a bit of a mess. Could really benefit from a (factory) HUD- Similarly, the entertainment unit is harder to navigate than the 2020 Kia Cerato I got as a rental a few weeks ago- More than one USB port in the front console would have been good (having them in the centre bin is less helpful)- Not giving the front passenger seat motorised adjustment seems really cheap on a 50k carEdit:- the 'premium' JBL sound system is not worth any extra money- The side mirrors still don't auto-fold when locking.

Here goes:Suppose you have your phone generally paired with your car via Bluetooth (BT), but they are not connected at this moment. Suppose you are at home, your car is in the garage downstairs, so the phone is not BT-connected to the car, and you just browsed through a p0rn site from your phone (not telling your wife and kids) and this is your last opened tab in ur browser, after which you put the phone aside and walked to the kitchen to have a bite to eat. Surely, you have a security screen lock on your phone (passworded with numbers or pattern), so the phone now locks itself up, and secure screen notifications are set to off. So you are safe as in noone can see what was open on your phone. Suppose your wife says ""Let's all go shopping!"", and all you and ur fam jump into the car (your phone is in your pocked, still locked). You turn on the car, and the infotainment shows the default screen with audio section in the top left corner. The car connects via BT to the phone (which is still locked!) and – voila! – that car's screen audio section now displays the name of the last track played and the URL!

I’m not sure if that’s even been solved reading the Rav4world forum.Agree on losing a lot of gear. I came from a 09 Prius that had a lot of “advanced” gear which 11 years on, only become mainstream so all I’ve gained is all-speed cruise control. I had radar cruise, pre-crash auto brake system, pre-crash seat belt pre-tensioners, self reverse parking.6 months on, I’m still coming to terms particularly of losing HUD after 10 years with it. Gear lever also is a learning curve getting used to a PRND setup. The Prius setup is more user friendly (Don't have to press P when I switch off the car) but just like the Prius C, it is there to not “scare” first time hybrid buyers. Flip side is that it pi22es off existing ones upgrading. Waiting for a Japanese aftermarket solution.The other thing having lived with it for this time is that the hybrid battery cooling fan (like the Prius) doesn’t kick in sufficiently to cool it down. They say it runs best at 36-37C. Once it gets to 44C, any acceleration is done by the ICE to protect the HV battery but I don’t ever hear the fan spool up sucking in air at any urgent rate. Heat is the biggest killer of the HV battery. The only way to cool it down effectively is to drive at a constant pace to reduce the load on the HV battery for 10mins and it might drop a degree or two. There’s no Scangauge command that can force the fan into fast like the Prius. (I need to learn how to make the commands coz there’s not a technical group of enthusiast unlike the Prius people)I could go full nerd on the HV system and what to look out for but it’s supposed to be an all managed eco system. 11 years on, it hasn’t changed the way it manages the health any differently than my Prius.",2021-Jan-3,whrl.pl/RgcEEQ

"lazydesi writes...2) Hybrid system similar to rav4 – an 1.6 litre T-GDI Smartstream petrol engine and a 44.2 kW electric motor powered by a 1.49 kWh lithium-ion battery........the current Rav4 is powered by 2.5 lit petrol engine and a 88kW electric motor for FWD models + an additional  40KW for AWD powered by a 1.6 kWh Ni-MH  battery driven by an eCVT transmission.Thanks for that.What is a bit confusing is how the new Tucson hybrid is being quoted as a combined total power of 171kW vs Rav4 of I think 163kW? Based on these figures, the Tucson still somehow appears to have more grunt. That's certainly what the video reviews out of Korea are also demonstrating.Here's an in-depth comparison between the two from a Korean source: https://youtu.be/W4prqioR-RAShe talks about the drive quality around 14 mins into the video. Here, the Tucson is doing much better than the Rav4.Toyota hybrid  technology   Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) is in the market since 1997.Hyundai hybrid technology is new to the market and Tucson  is the gen 1 product using that technology.Yes that's true. One would expect better reliability from the Toyota. I suppose the question for many would be, is the increased reliability worth all the other trade offs? Would the perks of the Tucson be enough to potentially beta-test a new technology.This entire discussion may be moot if Hyundai decides not to bring the hybrid here though.",2021-Jan-3,whrl.pl/RgcEQf

"pacman99 writes...Mind if you elaborate? I don't know much about hybrid drivetrains and was seriously considering the tucson hybrid if it comes here. Reviews out of Korea where it's already been released are pretty good but probably biased.Gladly. The hybrid system in the Tucson was superseded 23 years ago when Toyota released their hybrid system. Hyundai use a regular 6 speed auto transmission in conjunction with a 44kw electric motor that is sandwiched between the ICE engine and the transmission. Regular autos are inefficient and have a limited lifespan, as well as needing to constantly change gears. This also forces the ICE to operate in an inefficient RPM range, and also limits the usefulness of the electric motor.Toyota's hybrid system uses a planetary gearset in conjunction with 2 electric motors, or in the case of the AWD model 3 motors. The big motor has 88kw allowing for much greater electric assist. The planetary gearset is close to 100% efficient during operation and never needs to 'change gear' due to the way it works which allows the engine to run at very low RPM, improving efficiency. It (and the rest of the car) has been proven to travel extreme mileage without failure over the 15 million+ hybrids Toyota have sold since 1997, many in taxi and rideshare service.Long story short, if you buy a Hyundai hybrid, you're buying very old, inefficient and long superseded tech that Hyundai are only using because they don't want to license the far superior Toyota system like Honda, Mazda and Ford have done.",2021-Jan-3,whrl.pl/RgcFnj

"My previous car was 10 year old Forester base model.. no reverse cameras or other fancy gadgets. So, i can't really complain with all the new features at this stage. Loving the 360 degree or skyview camera... makes parking so much easier. Some of my gripes so far:1. What really annoys me for a $50K car is that, it doesn't have illumination on all the switches and buttons on the drivers door. Can't believe Toyota cheaped out on that. I find it really inconvenient, and will be swapping that module out soon.2. The other annoyance is the auto fold side mirror, which most knows about already. Once again, aftermarket job to get that fixed.3. Non LED internal lighting, indicator and reverse lights. The internal and reverse lights are very dull.4. Non electric passenger seat adjustment.5. Ventilates seats would have been handy in summer.6. Wireless charger can be hit and miss when trying to charge a phone.7. Only one USB port for infotainment system. As i am a regular user of Android Auto, my phone is always plugged in to USB port. To listen to music from a separate USB device, it needs to use the same USB port. It will not work on any other USB ports. Yes, i could have the music stored in the phone, but would like the option of having another USB device plugged in almost permanently as another source for audio. I think i saw a post where someone is using a USB hub.. might have to look into this.8. The school zone warning, on non school times. If i could get rid of this, but keep the other warnings. I like the speed camera and don't mind the speed limit warnings. Only if i can get the Toyota navigation map updated... as there is a new speed camera in my area, that is not on the map. You know it is there... but there are times you simply forget about it.Apart from these, i really like the smoothness of the drive of the car. It can get little noisy on a climb when engine is made to work, but then again my old forester sounded like a tank.Someone mentioned about disappointment about the OEM tyres on the car. I dont know if it is the car in general, or the tyre has something to do with it, but i find the ride very smooth and very impressed with it.DM",2021-Jan-4,whrl.pl/RgcGgN

Hyundai are not going to drop a dud engine into a 2021 model revamp.First, if the 'actual' fuel consumption figures are close, not the government tested figures, sure, you've got a point. Toyota hybrids basically always come remarkably close to achieving their tested figures in the real world, whereas other vehicles test figures are generally fantasy numbers. We don't know how the Hyundai hybrids perform yet though, we'll have to wait for professional and owner reviews to get a clear picture of the economy numbers, unless you want to be their guinea pig.Secondly, if you buy the Hyundai, you're also the guinea pig for Hyundai's hybrid reliability. They don't have the proven history of the Toyota system. Are their HV batteries reliable? How long do they last? What about the inverters? The electric motor? Is the HV cabling properly sized? There are a lot more things to go wrong on a hybrid, and only Toyota have proven they can do it right so far – even Honda couldn't get it right and ended up using Toyota's design. Dunno about you, but if I'm handing over $50k for a new car, I want something that millions of other people have test driven before me.Third, Hyundai have a recent history of doing the very thing you have trust that they won't do:https://thelemonfirm.com/2019/11/26/hyundai-and-kias-theta-ii-engines-manufacturing-defects-recalls-and-spontaneous-fires-are-just-the-beginning/https://www.autoblog.com/2020/12/04/hyundai-engine-recall/A basic, bog standard naturally aspirated 4 cly engine fitted to millions of cars (including the Sonata hybrid) had manufacturing defects that caused complete failure shortly outside of warranty, and Hyundai tried to wash their hands of it until the law got involved.

Unfortunately the front passenger seat can't be adjusted up and down. We moved it around....Sat in the GLX and Cruiser and both were the same. Even though the GLX does not have sun roof, there is still a dip and slope to it. So any bump we go over, he'll be hitting his head...Or only ever sitting in the back seat...which will p!$$ him off no end...We were surprised as generally find the front seat usually has higher head space than the rear...So RAV4 is off the list for me...A shame...But I can't have a car that will put my son in a bad mood....",2021-Jan-18,whrl.pl/Rgc73X

Driving  for a while would charge up the 12v battery again, but always ended up running it down again as the driving wasn't enough.I swapped to the B124X battery instead, wired to the fuse box. The battery only charges when the car is running, will get around 14-15hours of parking time with a 100% battery. Because I used a fuse tap, it charges faster than via the12v socket.That's what I would recommend. I mounted mine under the where the wireless charger is in the centre console.There's a large enough area that fits the B124X perfectly.

"The parking mode for BlackVue has been a big disappointment for me. It is not working as i was hoping  it would.Have the DR750x-2ch, and detection sensors are far too sensitive. Even with the lowest setting of ""1"", it continually triggers detection.. and basically records every minute. Tree leaves moving... people walking by, cars going by... lighting change... you name it... all gets picked up and triggers detection. I tried to configure the zone settings as well... to use only 1 row of blocks... slightly better... but still fair amount of false detections. I have given up for now.. and just let it falsely detect all it likes until the battery goes flat. I have turned off motion detection notification... was driving me nuts on the phone... i have mine configured to cloud at home, as the parked car can reach my wifi signal at home.I guess the other option is to simply disable motion detection in parking mode, and rely on impact detection to do its thing. However, this will only trigger if your car gets hit while parked or a trolley thumps into your car with some force in shopping center car park. Opening and closing your doors while parked triggers this detection too.Enjoy!!",2021-Jan-25,whrl.pl/RgdkL0

In my case I did want the features such as the moon roof, panoramic view monitor, 7 inch multi information display, electric seats, etc so I went for the Cruiser. The soft touch material in the Cruiser is also much nicer than the hard plastic in the GX and GXL even if it's not real leather.DåVØ writes...Can you open it from a distance with the remote?You can open the tailgate using the remote.

There are schools everywhere and it warns me even on Saturday! How do I disable it? I tried looking for the option in detail navigation settings but there is no school zone option for me.Second issue is the powered tailgate makes a loud beeping sound when it opens and closes. Its the same sound a big truck would make backing up. Can it be disabled?Third issue at the moment is when I back out of my driveway I need to pass our hedges on the way out which are pretty close to the car.

"How much is just the battery ""check""? I am sure I am going to DIY from 7th year like I do with my other hybrid. I still don't get what they actually do other than check if a code has been triggered.Btw, the battery won't need replacing at 10 year mark. It really depends on the condition you're using it for (I had my Prius for 11 yrs, still ran strong before I sold it). Although it's an additional gauge with more dedicated equipment, but HV temp plays a part in the longevity. So far I am not happy with the way the battery temp management is implemented with it ""overheating"" (i.e. >44C) at sedate driving pace where temps were in low 20C. When it does overheat, it doesn't kick the fan at full speed even at 46C and thus intervention to kick up the fan speed is required to drop it back. How you know it's overheated is when you touch the throttle in the slightest, it'd fire up the petrol motor even though you've got good charge.Also if you like to keep the battery for longer, ALWAYS warm up the car regardless of season till the engine cuts out (i.e. engine coolant at 40C).When driving it from dead cold will draw all its motive power from the HV battery and if you left the car at 50% HV charge, it'd go below the 40% limit and go into below operating range (40-80% is normal operating charge range for both NiMH and Li ion). Also note if you've got A/C on whilst warming up, the petrol motor will not supplement the electricity needed to run the A/C and also run below 40% until the engine coolant is at 40C.This post will probably be buried in this deep thread but anyway. If you want to keep the HV battery shiny side up, at the very least, warm up the car before moving. Fortunately the motor warms up quick (faster than the Prius anyway) so you're not waiting around that long.",2021-Feb-10,whrl.pl/RgdOJK

Ask for significant engine power and you'll get it from dead cold, you can hear the engine RPM rise well above idle, plus there is a whole lot more power available to the wheels than the max 60kW from MG2. I've only seen <40% SOC in the following conditions:Engine dead cold, outside temperature very low.Startup and normal driving until battery drops to roughly 40% SOC, corresponding to 2 out of 8 bars on the battery gauge.Then accelerator flat to the floor, max power – battery will dip down to about 30% SOC, then MG2 significantly reduces power delivery as it stops pulling power from the HV battery and engine is providing most of the power, roughly 55% mechanical torque straight into the PSD and about 45% through MG1 as electrical energy into MG2.Basically, I don't believe you have to warm up the engine to prevent low battery SOC in regular driving.

"Is the cut-price servicing a scam?I have a Rav4 Hybrid which went in for a 30k service late last year.Lately a noise developed. I took it back to the dealer – their mechanic told me it needed a wheel alignment – which they didn't do at their workshop.So I took it to a local tyre dealer who did the adjustment which he said was well out. Good, I don't blame Toyota for that, it can happen with potholes, speed humps or hitting the kerb.However, I was also told that the tyre pressures – all round – were 22psi when they needed to be between 32 and 40. He pumped them up to 36.He also told me the tyres needed rotating – I told him that was done at the last service – no, he said, it wasn't.Now tyre pressure checks and wheel rotation are service items and were shown as done on my service invoice.The thought occurs – what else was shown as done but wasn't?Are the fixed price services leading some dealers to cut corners?

"skdsh writes...They told us what colour the car would be upfront as they had already put this order in (silver)Ah ha.  Ok, well, they would've known full well that there were two chances of changing the colour.    Car paint is one of the first thing done when making a new car.   Once the panels are pressed and secured, then it's off to paint.   If  your car is now due in mid to late April, then it's basically already a finished product waiting at the docks to be loaded.The absolute best that the dealer might have been able to achieve was a 'swap' or 'trade' with another dealer that had your colour on order.My point is, car dealers say basically nothing that is true or factually correct.  They'll say whatever they can to secure your money, something like 'We'll more than likely be able to change the colour, but can't do anything without a commitment"" from you.

Interesting video on how to maintain battery filter in order to prolong battery lifehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1l-JNGMTEs,2021-Mar-12,whrl.pl/RgeHkM
Americans have pretty whacky views when it comes to servicing stuff. Generally they overpay for everything (oil change every 3000 miles) so this DIY stuff is probably an antidote to that. Surely the way to go is just to stick to the service routine? I wouldn't mess around with stuff to do with the battery to give anyone an excuse.The battery is under warranty for 10 years and the thing that will extend the life is the fact it sits for a middle charge and never dips to zero or charges to full.

I'm wondering if it has anything to do with me manually opening the mirror when the car was off to install the turning light. When I went to unlock the car to turn the hazard lights on for some testing it initiated it usual 'auto-open mirrors' sequence. There was a loud click/clunk at the end of the mirror motor noise sequence like it was trying to get the mirror back on the right gear/track. Could that cause an issue? Right now after testing multiple times, the auto open/close seems to work ok in terms of being smooth/doing its job, as the opening and closing sequences start at the same time and there's no worrying noises...only that there's a difference in when the sequences finish.3rd EDIT:I took a look at the car manual this morning and it talks about manually adjusting the mirrors if you require...don't know if manually adjusting the mirrors has anything to do with it...or why there was a loud clunk noise when going back to the auto function.",2021-May-13,whrl.pl/RggqPz

If most of your drive is less than 60kmh, then the fan won't go fast enough to cool things down quickly or with any urgency. Even when it overheats, the fan program will not change speed unless you're driving over those threshold.In my Li ion Prius v, I have never hit the heat threshold and never needed to trigger the fan manually.The only way to counter it is to trigger the fan to speed 6 (max) through OBD app (Dr Prius).",2021-Jun-5,whrl.pl/Rgg6f6

"I have been considering the RAV 4 Cruiser Hybrid as well. Have a very good deal via a neighbour who worked for the particular company I would be buying from. The only problem I have with the Cruiser is that I am about 6 feet 3 inches tall ( 188cm), and with the sun roof in the Cruiser I have to drop the drivers seat right down as low as it can go to get a comfortable driving position. When I sit in the front passenger's seat, which has no height adjustment , my head hits the roof of the car. You would have hoped that they would have at least provided basic height adjustment in the Cruiser. It is about $4000 more than the GLX??Any suggestions, and has anyone else had this problem.

There's a discussion on the Facebook RAV4 group about HUD and how people have not ever had a speeding ticket in 28 yrs of driving and that it's a distraction etc etc.In the hands of TMCA product planners, their job is to deliver significant spec differences to differentiate between grades. Sunroof is a ""free"" (not $ cost but car price is determined by market based pricing, not cost + margin) option not tied together with any other spec since it's a separate wiring harness module generally. From the menu (what they call Vehicle specification sheet) they get given from Toyota Japan, there's not much else they can choose.

"Yet they chose to remove the cruise control stalk they've used for 20 yrs that didn't need illumination (up/down, push, pull, press button all had individual actions) and made it worse by making every cruise control function a push button with illumination that spins with the steering wheel.Whilst we're on the subject of stupid ergonomics, the HVAC system is just frustrating as the buttons are small, and TBH, I don't know how many buttons from the left is the fan speed up and down which I know are next to each other. I rarely (never in the 1 yr I've owned it) ever use the climate control and don't ever use the dual zone full stop but whatever, people think it's a good feature and it's in there but annoying to spend way too much time fumbling for the fan up/down switch with eyes off the road.Same with getting CarPlay up on the screen requiring 1 push of the skinny button and a screen press. Why can't I get CP up with a button (and a big button at that given the real estate on the panel)?Then we get to the lower right knee buttons which the location itself is in a position where no one can see without bending down though Toyota/Lexus persist with this in all their cars. Getting back to the buttons located there, why is auto high beam the right most button? Like the power rear door, it's on the left most side which is ""easy"" to fumble your way across. This means the surround view button should be on the right. It'd be more utilised than switching auto high beam on and off.Fortunately this is fixable though Toyota tries to force installers to fit them in the way Toyota wants you with unique plastic slots for various buttons which is easily hacked off. So now, I have the surround view on the right most side as I use it daily to get out of my tight garage spot with auto high beam next to the power rear door.Anyway, thanks to these ergonomic changes, I am slowly becoming more accustomed to this new setup that I can easily switch brands once my RAV4 is replaced one day.

Basically it's not an ideal setup for traction but is best for efficiency.Snow-wise, I'd wish everyone stop saying it's great in snow. The standard Bridgestone HL33 are just plain old summer economy touring tyres harking back to the Turanza ER33 from 10+ years ago. They have little grip when cold and minimal to zero sips to grip cold/wet surfaces let alone snow. Treat them like slicks in the wet and drive it with respect because the E-four system isn't a magic panacea for all low grip surfaces. What ""grip"" you think it has is not much more than a 2WD.

Buller etc. 99.99% of its life will be spent in the city.I felt the $3000 saved would be better spent on fuel or replacing the hybrid battery after 10 years as i plan to keeping this for a long time.I must confess that I keep debating about changing my order to AWD sometimes.However it appears that the choice of tyres is very important and a 2WD with a very good set of tyres would be as good or better than an AWD with the standard tyres.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atayHQYqA3g,2021-Jul-16,whrl.pl/Rgij9T
